This is partially correct, as you do need to get approval from your DSO, but you do not necessarily need an offer letter from your employer to apply for CPT.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option B\nOption B states that you can apply for OPT (Optional Practical Training) up to 90 days before graduation and up to 60 days after graduation. This option is incorrect because it refers to OPT, not CPT. OPT is a different type of work authorization that allows international students to work in the United States after graduation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that you must submit a detailed job description explaining how the work is related to your field of study. This is partially correct, as you do need to demonstrate that the work is related to your field of study, but you do not necessarily need to submit a detailed job description.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option D\nOption D states that you can apply for OPT without a job offer. This option is incorrect because it refers to OPT, not CPT, and also because you do need a job offer to apply for CPT.\n\nStep 6: Choose the correct answer\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option A, but with the correction that you do not necessarily need an offer letter from your employer to apply for CPT.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" [A] \" [A] [A] [A] [A",

It's a type of work authorization for international students in the United States, allowing them to gain practical experience in their field of study.\n\n2. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - **Option A**: This option is incorrect because CPT is not limited to jobs related to your field of study. It can be any job that is part of your academic program.\n   - **Option B**: This option is correct. To apply for CPT, you typically need a CPT Request Form from your university, a Job Offer Letter from a U.S. employer, proof that CPT is part of your academic program, and a valid passport, visa, and I-94.\n   - **Option C**: This option is incorrect because E-Verify registration and completion of a new Form I-983 are requirements for OPT (Optional Practical Training), not CPT.\n   - **Option D**: This option is incorrect because once you complete your coursework, you can apply for CPT, not OPT.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**, which lists the typical documents required for CPT.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.

CPT is a type of training that is an integral part of an established curriculum, including internship, cooperative education, or practicum that is required as a basis for acquiring mastery of the skills and techniques used in the student's field of study.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Yes but you must get approval from your DSO and academic department and it must align with your programs requirements.\nThis option suggests that a student can work before receiving CPT authorization, but only if they obtain approval from their Designated School Official (DSO) and academic department, and if the work aligns with their program's requirements. This seems plausible, as the DSO and academic department would need to verify that the work is indeed part of the student's curriculum.\n\n(B) CPT approval typically takes 510 business days after submitting the required documents to your Designated School Official (DSO).\nThis option suggests that CPT approval can take a significant amount of time, but it does not directly answer the question of whether a student can work before receiving CPT authorization.\n\n(C) No you must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization before starting work.\nThis option suggests that a student cannot work before receiving CPT authorization, and must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization before starting work.\n\n(D) Yes but if you do 12 months of full-time CPT you lose eligibility for OPT.\nThis option suggests that a student can work before receiving CPT authorization, but if they do 12 months of full-time CPT, they will lose eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT).\n\nBased on the analysis, option (A) seems to be the most plausible answer, as it suggests that a student can work before receiving CPT authorization, but only if they obtain approval from their DSO and academic department, and if the work aligns with their program's requirements.\n\nThe final answer is: (A) Yes but you must get approval from your DSO and academic department and it must align with your programs requirements.\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" (A) Yes but you must get approval from your DSO and academic",

Additionally, leaving the U.S. is not a necessary step in the OPT application process.\n\nOption (B): This option is correct because an employer can file an H-1B petition for a student while they are on OPT or STEM OPT.

Finally, select the best answer from the given options.\n\nOption (A) discusses the eligibility criteria for Optional Practical Training (OPT), which is a type of work authorization for international students in the United States. To be eligible for OPT, students must have completed at least one academic year of full-time study in a degree-granting program at a U.S. accredited college or university. If a student has used 12 months of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT), they are not eligible for OPT. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nOption (B) lists the steps to avoid rejection of an OPT application. These steps include ensuring all required fields are completed accurately, submitting all necessary supporting documents, paying the correct filing fee, and signing the application electronically. While these steps are essential for a successful OPT application, they do not directly answer the question of how long OPT processing takes. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nOption (C) states that USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) typically takes 90-120 days to process an OPT application. This is a reasonable estimate, as the processing time for OPT applications can vary depending on the workload of the USCIS service center and the completeness of the application. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) is blank and does not provide any information. Therefore, it is not a viable option.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is option (C), which states that USCIS typically takes 90-120 days to process an OPT application. This is a reasonable estimate based on the workload of the USCIS service center and the completeness of the application. Therefore, option (C) is the best answer to the question of how long OPT processing takes. \n\nThe final answer is (C).  I hope it is correct.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nOption (A) suggests that you cannot work until you receive your EAD (Employment Authorization Document) card and reach the start date of your OPT (Optional Practical Training) period. However, this is not entirely accurate. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), you can start working 90 days before your OPT start date, as long as you have applied for your EAD and have a pending application. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nOption (B) is blank and does not provide any information.\n\nOption (C) seems to be describing the requirements for applying for CPT (Curricular Practical Training), not OPT. CPT is a type of training that is part of your academic program, and it requires a CPT Request Form from your university, a job offer letter from a U.S. employer, proof that CPT is part of your academic program, and a valid passport, visa, and I-94. This option is not relevant to the question of working while waiting for OPT approval.\n\nOption (D) suggests that you can work while waiting for OPT approval as long as you have not used 12 months of full-time CPT. This is correct. According to the USCIS, if you have not used 12 months of full-time CPT, you remain eligible for OPT. You can start working 90 days before your OPT start date, as long as you have applied for your EAD and have a pending application. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (D) Yes, as long as you have not used 12 months of full-time CPT, you remain eligible for OPT.

Let's break down each option:\n\n(A) This option is incorrect because the 60-day grace period is related to F-1 student status, not Form I-765. F-1 students have a 60-day grace period to leave the U.S. or find another legal status after their program ends.\n\n(B) This option is incorrect because it describes the online application process for Form I-539, not Form I-765. Form I-539 is used to request a change or extension of nonimmigrant status, and it requires uploading digital copies of supporting documents.\n\n(C) This option is incorrect because it describes the consequences of a denied Optional Practical Training (OPT) application, not Form I-765. If an OPT application is denied, the student must leave the U.S. within 60 days unless they transfer to another school or apply for a different visa.\n\n(D) This option is correct because it accurately describes Form I-765.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to understand what Form I-765 is and what it is used for. Form I-765 is the Application for Employment Authorization, which is used to request work authorization from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

This option is incorrect because taking a Leave of Absence is not a requirement for applying for CPT, and leaving the U.S. is not a necessary consequence of applying for CPT.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nOption (B) states that a new OPT period is granted for each higher degree level (bachelors, masters, PhD). This option is incorrect because OPT (Optional Practical Training) is only granted once per degree level, not for each higher degree level.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption (C) states that an employer can file an H-1B petition for a student while they are on OPT or STEM OPT, and if approved, the student may qualify for a Cap-Gap Extension allowing them to work until H-1B status begins. This option is incorrect because CPT is being discussed, not OPT or STEM OPT.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option (D)\nOption (D) states that no, a student must complete one academic year (two full semesters) before they are eligible for CPT unless their program requires immediate participation in CPT. This option is correct because, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a student must be enrolled in a degree program for at least one academic year (two full semesters) before they are eligible for CPT, unless their program requires immediate participation in CPT.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" (D) \" (D) \" (D) \" (D)",

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the requirements for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for F-1 students. CPT is a type of work authorization that allows F-1 students to gain practical experience in their field of study while pursuing their degree. To apply for CPT, students must submit a request to their Designated School Official (DSO), who will review the request and issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization if the request is approved.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Yes, your DSO will issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization every time you apply. This statement is true. When a student applies for CPT, their DSO will review the request and issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization if the request is approved.\n\n(B) Yes, but your new employer must be E-Verify registered and complete a new Form I-983. This statement is partially true. While it is true that the employer must be E-Verify registered, the completion of a new Form I-983 is not necessarily required for each CPT request.\n\n(C) Working without CPT authorization is a serious violation of your F-1 status and you may be required to leave the U.S. immediately. This statement is true. Working without CPT authorization is a serious violation of F-1 status and can result in severe consequences, including being required to leave the U.S. immediately.\n\n(D) No, you must have a formal employer-employee relationship and the employer must complete a training plan (Form I-983). This statement is partially true. While a formal employer-employee relationship is required, the completion of a training plan (Form I-983) is not necessarily required for each CPT request.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Yes, your DSO will issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization every time you apply.\n\nThis answer is supported by the fact that when a student applies for CPT, their DSO will review the request and issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization if the request is approved. Therefore, a new I-20 is required for each CPT request. \n\nThe final answer is (A).  I hope it is correct. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe question is asking about the consequences of working on Curricular Practical Training (CPT) without authorization. CPT is a type of training that is an integral part of an established curriculum, and it requires authorization from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or the student's Designated School Official (DSO).\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) No you must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization before starting work.\nThis option is incorrect because it implies that working on CPT without authorization is not a serious issue. However, working on CPT without authorization is a violation of F-1 status.\n\n(B) CPT can be part-time (20 hours or fewer per week) during the academic year and full-time (more than 20 hours per week) during school breaks.\nThis option is incorrect because it describes the rules for CPT, not the consequences of working on CPT without authorization.\n\n(C) Yes you get a new OPT period for each higher degree level (bachelors masters PhD).\nThis option is incorrect because it describes the rules for Optional Practical Training (OPT), not the consequences of working on CPT without authorization.\n\n(D) Working without CPT authorization is a serious violation of your F-1 status and you may be required to leave the U.S. immediately.\nThis option is correct because working on CPT without authorization is a serious violation of F-1 status, and it may result in severe consequences, including being required to leave the U.S. immediately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Working without CPT authorization is a serious violation of your F-1 status and you may be required to leave the U.S. immediately.\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" \n\n(D) Working without CPT authorization is a serious violation of your F",

CPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students that allows them to gain practical experience in their field of study.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option A\nOption A states that the Designated School Official (DSO) will issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization every time the student applies. However, this is not accurate. The DSO will only issue a new I-20 if there is a change in the student's program or if the student needs to extend their CPT authorization.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option B\nOption B states that CPT does not require a separate application fee to USCIS. While it is true that CPT does not require a separate application fee to USCIS, this option does not directly answer the question of whether it is possible to work multiple jobs on CPT.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that yes, it is possible to work multiple jobs on CPT, but each job requires separate CPT authorization and must be approved by the university. This option is accurate. F-1 students can work multiple jobs on CPT, but each job must be approved by the DSO and listed on the student's I-20.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option D\nOption D states that yes, students get a new OPT period for each higher degree level (bachelors, masters, PhD).

However, not all work experiences require CPT authorization.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Yes but only one online course per semester can count toward full-time enrollment. - This option is incorrect because the requirement for CPT authorization is not related to the number of online courses a student takes.\n\n(B) Yes as long as your I-20 is valid. However if you leave you must renew your visa before returning. - This option is also incorrect because the validity of the I-20 and the need to renew a visa before returning are unrelated to the requirement for CPT authorization.\n\n(C) The fee is $470 for OPT and STEM OPT. - This option is incorrect because the fee for OPT (Optional Practical Training) and STEM OPT (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Optional Practical Training) is not relevant to the question of whether unpaid work requires CPT authorization.\n\n(D) Yes even unpaid internships may require CPT if they provide work experience related to your major. - This option is correct.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nTo answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding CPT**: CPT stands for Curricular Practical Training. It is a type of work authorization for international students in the United States. CPT allows students to gain practical experience in their field of study while pursuing their degree.\n\n2. **Requirements for CPT**: To be eligible for CPT, students typically need to be enrolled in a degree program, have completed at least one academic year, and have a job offer related to their field of study.\n\n3. **Employer-Specific CPT**: CPT is employer-specific, meaning that if a student changes employers, they must apply for a new CPT authorization.\n\n4. **Formal Job Offer Letter**: While a formal job offer letter is not strictly required for CPT, it is often necessary to demonstrate a job offer related to the student's field of study.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) **Yes as long as the job is related to your field of study**: This option is partially correct, as the job must be related to the student's field of study. However, it does not address the requirement for a formal job offer letter.\n\n(B) **No CPT is employer-specific. If you change employers you must apply for a new CPT authorization**: This option is incorrect, as it does not address the requirement for a job offer related to the student's field of study.\n\n(C) **Yes a formal job offer letter is required to apply for CPT**: This option is the most accurate, as a formal job offer letter is often necessary to demonstrate a job offer related to the student's field of study.\n\n(D) **You may need to apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. immediately**: This option is incorrect, as it does not address the requirement for a job offer related to the student's field of study.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\"C\"[/X] [/X] [/X] [/X] [/",

CPT is a type of work authorization for international students, but it has different eligibility criteria and application procedures than OPT.\n\nOption B: This option is correct. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) regulations, international students can apply for OPT up to 90 days before graduation and up to 60 days after graduation.\n\nOption C: This option is incorrect because it is not relevant to the timing of applying for OPT. Informing the Designated School Official (DSO) and stopping work are not related to the application process for OPT.\n\nOption D: This option is incorrect because it is not accurate.

OPT is a program that allows F-1 students to work in their field of study in the United States for up to 12 or 36 months, depending on the type of OPT.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) You lose eligibility for OPT and must leave the U.S.\nIf you don't apply for OPT within 60 days of graduation, you may lose the opportunity to participate in OPT, but it doesn't necessarily mean you must leave the U.S. immediately. You may still be eligible for other types of work authorization or have other options available.\n\n(B) Yes but each CPT requires separate approval from your school and must be related to your degree program.\nThis option is incorrect because it's talking about Curricular Practical Training (CPT), not OPT. CPT is a type of work authorization that allows F-1 students to work on-campus or off-campus as part of their academic program.\n\n(C) No you must travel outside the U.S. to renew your F-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate.\nThis option is incorrect because it's talking about renewing an F-1 visa, not OPT. If you don't apply for OPT within 60 days of graduation, you won't necessarily need to travel outside the U.S. to renew your F-1 visa.\n\n(D) A 24-month extension for students with STEM degrees making their total OPT period 36 months.\nThis option is partially correct. Students with STEM degrees (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are eligible for a 24-month extension of OPT, making their total OPT period 36 months. However, this option doesn't address the consequence of not applying for OPT within 60 days of graduation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but option (A) is the closest to being correct. If you don't apply for OPT within 60 days of graduation, you may lose the opportunity to participate in OPT, but it doesn't necessarily mean you must leave the U.S. immediately. You may still be eligible for other types of work authorization or have other options available.

Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe OPT (Optional Practical Training) program allows international students to work in the United States for up to 12 months after completing their studies. If an OPT application is rejected, the applicant has the option to resubmit a corrected application if there is still time within their 60-day grace period. This means that option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because submitting an OPT request to the school and filing Form I-765 with USCIS is the process for initially applying for OPT, not for resubmitting a rejected application. Option (B) is also incorrect because E-Verify registration is not relevant to the process of resubmitting a rejected OPT application. Option (C) is incorrect because while it is true that international students have 60 days to either leave the U.S., transfer to another school, or change their visa status after completing their program or OPT, this is not directly related to the process of resubmitting a rejected OPT application.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) You may resubmit a corrected application if there is still time within your 60-day grace period. \n\nThe final answer is (D).  I hope it is correct. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.

OPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students, and the length of the OPT period depends on the degree level, but this does not affect the ability to travel outside the U.S.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because it is about filing Form I-765 online, which is the application for OPT, but it does not address the question of traveling outside the U.S. while the OPT application is pending.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it is about Curricular Practical Training (CPT), which is a different type of work authorization for F-1 students, and it is not relevant to the question of traveling outside the U.S. while OPT is pending.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer because it accurately states that it is risky to travel outside the U.S. while an OPT application is pending, especially if the F-1 visa is expired. If the OPT application is denied, the student may not be able to re-enter the U.S. if their F-1 visa is expired.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Its risky.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. Finally, choose the best answer based on your analysis.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking whether it is possible to take a second job while on Optional Practical Training (OPT), which is a type of work authorization for international students in the United States.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (A)\nOption (A) states that yes, you can take a second job while on OPT, but all jobs must be related to your field of study. However, this is not a requirement for taking a second job on OPT. OPT allows students to work in any field, not just their field of study. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nOption (B) states that you must inform your DSO and stop working immediately to avoid status violations. However, this is not a requirement for taking a second job on OPT. While it is true that you must inform your DSO of any changes in your employment, you are not required to stop working immediately. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption (C) states that CPT approval typically takes 510 business days after submitting the required documents to your Designated School Official (DSO). However, this is not relevant to taking a second job on OPT. CPT (Curricular Practical Training) is a type of work authorization for international students, but it is not related to OPT.

While this is true, it is not relevant to the question of whether you can take a second job on OPT. Form I-765 is used to apply for OPT, but it does not address the issue of taking a second job.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe question is asking what happens if your STEM OPT (Optional Practical Training) is denied. STEM OPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students in the U.S. who have completed their degree in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) You get a 60-day grace period to leave the U.S. or find another legal status.\nThis option is incorrect because a STEM OPT denial does not automatically trigger a 60-day grace period. A 60-day grace period typically applies to F-1 students who have completed their program of study, not those whose OPT has been denied.\n\n(B) nan\nThis option is a placeholder and does not provide any information.\n\n(C) You must apply for a Leave of Absence get DSO approval and may need to leave the U.S.\nThis option is correct.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because changing your major after applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT) does not necessarily mean that all jobs must be related to your field of study. OPT allows students to work in any field, not just their field of study.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because changing your major after applying for OPT does not require separate CPT (Curricular Practical Training) authorization for each job. CPT is a type of training that is part of a student's academic program, and it is not related to OPT.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it discusses the filing fee for Form I-765, which is unrelated to the question of changing one's major after applying for OPT.\n\nOption (D) is correct because changing one's major after applying for OPT may affect one's eligibility for STEM OPT (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Optional Practical Training).

Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe F-1 visa is a type of non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the United States to pursue academic studies. The visa is typically valid for the duration of the student's program, but it can expire before the program is completed. If the F-1 visa expires, the student must take action to maintain their status in the United States.\n\nOption (A) suggests that the student must wait until they receive their EAD (Employment Authorization Document) card and reach the start date to stay in the U.S. However, this option is incorrect because the EAD card is not required for F-1 students to stay in the U.S. after their visa expires.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it discusses CPT (Curricular Practical Training), which is a type of work authorization for F-1 students, but it is not relevant to the question of whether the student can stay in the U.S. after their F-1 visa expires.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it discusses Form I-765, which is the official USCIS application used to request work authorization, but it is not relevant to the question of whether the student can stay in the U.S. after their F-1 visa expires.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the student can stay in the U.S. as long as their I-20 is valid, but if they leave, they must renew their visa before returning. This option is correct because the I-20 is a document issued by the student's school that certifies the student's enrollment and eligibility for F-1 status. As long as the I-20 is valid, the student can maintain their F-1 status in the U.S., even if their F-1 visa has expired.

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each.

CPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students that allows them to work on-campus or off-campus as part of their academic program, whereas OPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students that allows them to work in their field of study after completing their degree.\n\n(B) No CPT is only available to full-time students unless it is your final semester and you are approved for a reduced course load.\nThis option is incorrect because it is not relevant to the question of what happens if an F-1 student is laid off while on OPT.\n\n(C) You must find a new job within 90 days (150 days for STEM OPT) or leave the U.S.\nThis option is correct.

Specifically, it asks about the requirements for participating in STEM OPT (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Optional Practical Training), which is an extension of regular OPT for students in STEM fields.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Option (A)\nOption (A) suggests that informing the Designated School Official (DSO) and the potential impact on eligibility for STEM OPT is a requirement. This is partially correct, as students must notify their DSO of their intention to apply for STEM OPT. However, the impact on eligibility is not explicitly stated as a requirement in this option.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Option (B)\nOption (B) states that a formal employer-employee relationship and a completed training plan (Form I-983) are necessary for STEM OPT. This is accurate, as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires students to have a formal employer-employee relationship and for their employer to complete a training plan as part of the STEM OPT application process.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate Option (C)\nOption (C) suggests that as long as the job is related to the student's field of study, they can participate in STEM OPT.

While it is true that you need to get approval from your DSO to participate in CPT, this statement is not entirely accurate. You do not need to submit an offer letter from your employer to participate in CPT.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that you must take at least 9 credits (graduate) or 12 credits (undergraduate) per semester.

CPT is a type of work authorization that allows F-1 students to gain practical experience in their field of study. To apply for CPT, F-1 students must have a job offer from an employer that is related to their field of study.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) No you must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization before starting work.\nThis option is incorrect because it implies that F-1 students do not need a job offer before applying for CPT, which is not true.\n\n(B) Yes CPT is employer-specific and you must have a job offer before applying.\nThis option is correct because CPT is indeed employer-specific, and F-1 students must have a job offer from an employer related to their field of study before applying for CPT.\n\n(C) Typically no. Once you complete your coursework you are expected to apply for OPT instead.\nThis option is incorrect because it implies that F-1 students cannot apply for CPT after completing their coursework, which is not true. F-1 students can apply for CPT at any time during their program, as long as it is related to their field of study.\n\n(D) Yes F-1 students seeking OPT can file Form I-765 online. Ensure you have obtained a recommendation from your Designated School Official (DSO) before applying.\nThis option is incorrect because it refers to OPT (Optional Practical Training), not CPT. OPT is a different type of work authorization that allows F-1 students to gain practical experience in their field of study after completing their coursework.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: (B) Yes CPT is employer-specific and you must have a job offer before applying.\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" [B] \" [X] [B] [X] [B",

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe question is asking if it is possible to have multiple Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorizations. CPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students that allows them to gain practical experience in their field of study.\n\nOption (A) mentions STEM OPT, which is a type of Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. This option is not relevant to the question of multiple CPT authorizations.\n\nOption (B) suggests that multiple CPT authorizations are possible, but only if approved by the Designated School Official (DSO) and academic department, and if it aligns with the program's requirements. This option seems plausible.\n\nOption (C) states that multiple CPT authorizations are possible as long as each job meets the CPT eligibility criteria. This option is also plausible.\n\nOption (D) mentions applying for H-1B, O-1, or other visas from within the U.S. This option is not relevant to the question of multiple CPT authorizations.\n\nBased on the analysis, options (B) and (C) seem to be the most plausible answers. However, option (C) is more concise and directly addresses the question of multiple CPT authorizations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Yes you can apply for multiple CPT authorizations as long as each job meets CPT eligibility criteria. \n\nThis answer is based on the understanding that CPT is a type of work authorization that allows F-1 students to gain practical experience in their field of study, and that multiple CPT authorizations are possible as long as each job meets the CPT eligibility criteria. This is in line with the regulations and guidelines set by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). \n\nThe reasoning skill required to answer this question is the ability to analyze the options and evaluate their relevance to the question, as well as the ability to understand the regulations and guidelines related to CPT and F-1 student status. This requires a comprehensive knowledge of statutory law and case precedent, as well as the ability to apply that knowledge to specific scenarios. \n\nIn this case, the correct answer is option (C), which is supported by the regulations and guidelines related to CPT and F-1 student status. Options (A) and (D) are not relevant to the question, and option (B) is plausible but not as concise or directly relevant as option\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" \n(C)  Yes you can apply for multiple CPT authorizations as",

CPT allows students to gain practical experience in their field of study while pursuing their degree.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) This option states that CPT is only available to full-time students unless it is the student's final semester and they are approved for a reduced course load. However, this is not entirely accurate. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), CPT is available to both full-time and part-time students, as long as the training is an integral part of the student's curriculum.\n\n(B) This option suggests that part-time students can engage in CPT, but they are limited to 20 hours per week during the academic year. This is partially correct, as part-time students can engage in CPT, but there is no specific hour limit mentioned in the regulations.\n\n(C) This option states that part-time students need an SSN (Social Security Number) to get paid and must apply for an SSN after receiving CPT approval. However, this is not accurate. While an SSN may be required for employment, it is not a requirement for CPT approval.\n\n(D) This option suggests that part-time students get a new OPT (Optional Practical Training) period for each higher degree level (bachelors, masters, PhD). However, this is not accurate. OPT is a type of work authorization for international students, but it is not related to CPT.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Yes, but you are limited to 20 hours per week during the academic year. If you are on full-time CPT or OPT, you should consult your DSO (Designated School Official) before working on-campus.\n\nThis option is the most accurate, as it acknowledges that part-time students can engage in CPT, but with certain limitations. However, it's worth noting that the 20-hour limit is not explicitly mentioned in the regulations, and it's always best to consult with a DSO or an immigration attorney for specific guidance. \n\nThe final answer is (B).  I hope it is correct. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or have any other questions.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires F-1 students to submit their OPT application from within the United States. If you leave the U.S. before submitting your OPT application, you will not be eligible for OPT.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect.

Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe question is asking whether it is possible to participate in Optional Practical Training (OPT) after completing a master's degree if the individual has already participated in OPT after completing their bachelor's degree.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) You must leave the U.S. immediately unless you have other visa options.\nThis option is incorrect because it implies that the individual must leave the U.S. immediately, which is not necessarily true. The individual may still be eligible for OPT after completing their master's degree.\n\n(B) Yes but you are limited to 20 hours per week during the academic year. If you are on full-time CPT or OPT you should consult your DSO before working on-campus.\nThis option is partially correct in that it acknowledges that the individual can participate in OPT after completing their master's degree. However, it incorrectly states that the individual is limited to 20 hours per week during the academic year. The 20-hour per week limitation only applies to part-time CPT, not OPT.\n\n(C) No you must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization before starting work.\nThis option is incorrect because it implies that the individual must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization, which is not necessary for OPT.\n\n(D) Yes you get a new OPT period for each higher degree level (bachelors masters PhD).\nThis option is correct. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) regulations, F-1 students are eligible for a new 12-month OPT period after completing a higher degree level, such as a master's degree. This means that the individual can participate in OPT after completing their master's degree, even if they have already participated in OPT after completing their bachelor's degree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Yes you get a new OPT period for each higher degree level (bachelors masters PhD). \n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that USCIS regulations allow F-1 students to participate in a new OPT period after completing a higher degree level, such as a master's degree. This means that the individual can participate in OPT after completing their master's degree, even if they have already participated in OPT after completing their bachelor's degree. The other options are incorrect because they either imply that the individual must leave the U.S. immediately, are limited to 20 hours per week during the academic year, or must wait for approval and receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization, which is not necessary for OPT.\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" \n\n(D)  Yes you get a new OPT period for each higher degree",

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe STEM OPT extension is a type of Optional Practical Training (OPT) that allows international students in the United States who have completed their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degree programs to work in their field for an additional 24 months beyond their initial 12-month OPT period. This extension is made possible by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and is designed to provide students with more time to gain practical experience in their field, which can be beneficial for their future careers.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) No you only get one OPT per degree level.\n- This statement is incorrect. Students are eligible for one 12-month OPT period per degree level, but they can apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension if their degree is in a STEM field.\n\n(B) A 24-month extension for students with STEM degrees making their total OPT period 36 months.\n- This statement is correct. Students with STEM degrees can apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension, which adds 24 months to their initial 12-month OPT period, making their total OPT period 36 months.\n\n(C) Form I-765 is the official USCIS application used to request work authorization (OPT STEM OPT etc.).\n- This statement is partially correct.

Students can use Form I-765 to apply for OPT, STEM OPT, and other types of work authorization.\n\n(D) nan\n- This option is blank and does not provide any information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) A 24-month extension for students with STEM degrees making their total OPT period 36 months. \n\nThe final answer is (B).

Failing a course can affect a student's ability to maintain their immigration status, regardless of their job.\n\n(C) This option suggests that failing a course does not immediately affect a student's immigration status, but falling below full-time enrollment can. This is a more accurate representation of the consequences of failing a course on a student's immigration status.\n\n(D) This option is blank and does not provide any information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Failing does not immediately affect your status but falling below full-time enrollment can. Contact your DSO for options.\n\nThis option accurately reflects the consequences of failing a course on a student's immigration status. Failing a course does not immediately affect a student's immigration status, but falling below full-time enrollment can. Therefore, students who fail a course should contact their Designated School Official (DSO) for options and guidance on how to maintain their immigration status. \n\nThe final answer is (C).

Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nThe F-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to study in the United States. One of the requirements for maintaining F-1 status is full-time enrollment in a course of study. Online courses can be part of a student's course load, but there are certain restrictions.\n\nOption (A) states that online courses can only be taken if the student applies for a Leave of Absence and may need to leave the U.S. during this period. This is not entirely accurate. While a Leave of Absence may be necessary in some cases, it is not a requirement for taking online courses.\n\nOption (B) states that yes, online courses can be taken, but only one online course per semester can count toward full-time enrollment. This is not accurate. There is no limit on the number of online courses that can be taken, as long as the student is enrolled full-time.\n\nOption (C) states that no, online courses cannot be taken because STEM OPT requires paid employment with an E-Verify employer. This is not relevant to the question. STEM OPT is a type of Optional Practical Training (OPT) that allows F-1 students to work in the U.S. in a STEM field, but it does not affect the student's ability to take online courses.\n\nOption (D) states that it's risky to take online courses if your application is pending and your F-1 visa is expired, as you may not be allowed to re-enter the U.S. This is not accurate. If a student's F-1 visa is expired, they may still be allowed to re-enter the U.S. as long as they have a valid visa application pending and can demonstrate that they have maintained their F-1 status.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Yes, but only one online course per semester can count toward full-time enrollment. However, this is not entirely accurate. There is no limit on the number of online courses that can be taken, as long as the student is enrolled full-time. A more accurate answer would be that online courses can be part of a student's course load, but the student must ensure that they are enrolled full-time to maintain their F-1 status.\n\nThe final answer is (B).

This is not relevant to the question of what happens if a visa expires but an I-20 is still valid.\n\nOption (B) suggests that if a visa expires but an I-20 is still valid, the person can stay in the U.S. but must renew their visa before returning if they travel outside the country.

The options mention different scenarios or requirements related to these work authorization programs.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (A)\nOption (A) is incomplete and does not provide any information that can be analyzed.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nOption (B) suggests that even unpaid internships may require CPT if they provide work experience related to the student's major. This statement seems plausible because CPT is designed to provide practical experience in the student's field of study, and unpaid internships can still offer valuable work experience.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption (C) mentions that USCIS takes about 90 days to process OPT applications, suggesting that students should apply early. This statement is accurate because the processing time for OPT applications can vary, but 90 days is a commonly cited timeframe.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option (D)\nOption (D) states that yes, OPT can be extended, but the employer must sponsor the student, and the process can take years. This statement is partially accurate in that OPT can be extended through the STEM OPT extension, which requires employer sponsorship. However, the processing time for the STEM OPT extension is typically several months, not years.\n\nStep 6: Select the correct answer\nBased on the analysis, options (B) and (C) seem to be accurate statements.

Therefore, it is not relevant to the question.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Option B\nOption B states that working full-time on CPT for 12 months or more can impact OPT eligibility, but part-time CPT does not. This option directly addresses the relationship between CPT and OPT.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating Option C\nOption C suggests that as long as the job is related to the field of study, CPT does not affect OPT. However, this option does not accurately reflect the rules regarding CPT and OPT.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating Option D\nOption D states that a student can apply for OPT without a job offer. While this is true, it does not address the impact of CPT on OPT.\n\n## Step 6: Selecting the Best Answer\nBased on the analysis, Option B is the most accurate answer.

This option is correct because CPT is indeed employer-specific, and changing employers requires a new CPT authorization.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate Option D\nOption D states that you must wait for your EAD card and your official OPT start date.

We need to determine what OPT is.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (A)\nOption (A) states that if your employer files your H-1B petition before your OPT expires, you can continue working until October 1st when H-1B status begins. This option is incorrect because OPT and H-1B are two different types of work authorizations. OPT is a temporary work authorization for F-1 students, while H-1B is a non-immigrant work visa for specialty occupations.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nOption (B) states that Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a temporary work authorization for F-1 students allowing them to work in their field of study for up to 12 months after graduation. This option is correct because OPT is indeed a temporary work authorization for F-1 students, allowing them to work in their field of study for up to 12 months after graduation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption (C) states that you may resubmit a corrected application if there is still time within your 60-day grace period. This option is incorrect because it is not related to the definition of OPT.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option (D)\nOption (D) states that yes, but the business must be related to your major and you must work at least 20 hours per week. This option is incorrect because it adds additional requirements that are not part of the definition of OPT.\n\nStep 6: Select the best answer\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B) because it accurately defines OPT as a temporary work authorization for F-1 students allowing them to work in their field of study for up to 12 months after graduation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\"B\"[/X] [/X] [/X] [/X] [/",

This is incorrect because OPT is not dependent on employer sponsorship, and the process typically takes several months, not years.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option B\nOption B states that if your OPT is denied, you must leave the U.S. within 60 days unless you transfer to another school or apply for a different visa. This is incorrect because if your OPT is denied, you can appeal the decision or apply for a different type of visa, but you are not required to leave the U.S. immediately.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that you should apply for OPT if all jobs must be related to your field of study. This is incorrect because OPT allows students to work in any field, not just their field of study.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option D\nOption D states that you can apply for OPT up to 90 days before graduation and up to 60 days after graduation.

This is incorrect because you can work while your OPT application is pending, as long as you have a valid EAD.\n\nOption (B) states that you must have a formal employer-employee relationship and the employer must complete a training plan (Form I-983). This is incorrect because while a formal employer-employee relationship and a training plan are required for CPT (Curricular Practical Training), they are not required for OPT.\n\nOption (C) states that unpaid internships are allowed if they comply with Department of Labor guidelines and your schools CPT/OPT rules. This is correct because unpaid internships are allowed under OPT, as long as they comply with Department of Labor guidelines and your school's CPT/OPT rules.\n\nOption (D) states that you must be physically present in the U.S. when applying. This is incorrect because you can apply for OPT from outside the United States, but you must be physically present in the U.S. when your OPT application is approved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Yes unpaid internships are allowed if they comply with Department of Labor guidelines and your schools CPT/OPT rules. \n\nThe final answer is (C).

Finally, choose the best answer based on your analysis.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking what happens if an Optional Practical Training (OPT) application is denied. OPT is a type of visa that allows international students to work in the United States for up to 12 months after completing their studies.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option A\nOption A states that if your OPT is denied, you must leave the U.S. within 60 days unless you transfer to another school or apply for a different visa. This option seems plausible because if an OPT application is denied, the student would no longer have a valid reason to stay in the U.S. for work purposes.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option B\nOption B states that if your OPT is denied, all jobs must be in your field of study. This option does not make sense because the denial of an OPT application would not impose additional restrictions on the type of jobs the student can work.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that if your OPT is denied, you cannot engage in unpaid or paid work until you receive your EAD card and your OPT start date arrives. This option is incorrect because if an OPT application is denied, the student would not be eligible to work in the U.S. regardless of whether they have an EAD card or not.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option D\nOption D states that if your OPT is denied, you must be physically present in the U.S. when you submit your OPT application. This option is incorrect because there is no requirement for the student to be physically present in the U.S. when submitting an OPT application.\n\nStep 6: Choose the best answer\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is option A. If an OPT application is denied, the student must leave the U.S. within 60 days unless they transfer to another school or apply for a different visa.\n\nThe final answer is: (A) If your OPT is denied you must leave the U.S. within 60 days unless you transfer to another school or apply for a different visa.\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" (A) If your OPT is denied you must leave the U.S.",

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nTo answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question**: The question is about applying for a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training (OPT) extension. OPT is a type of work authorization for international students in the United States, allowing them to gain practical work experience in their field of study. A STEM OPT extension is a 24-month extension of the initial 12-month OPT period, making the total OPT period 36 months, for students with STEM-designated degrees.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Options**:\n\n    -   **Option A**: This option lists the general requirements for applying for OPT, which includes a completed Form I-765, an OPT Recommendation I-20 from the school, a copy of the passport, visa, and I-94, two passport-size photos, and the USCIS filing fee. However, it does not specifically mention the STEM OPT extension or the requirement of a STEM-designated degree.\n    \n    -   **Option B**: This option mentions CPT (Curricular Practical Training), which is a different type of work authorization for international students. It requires a CPT Request Form from the university, a job offer letter from a U.S. employer, proof that CPT is part of the academic program, and a valid passport, visa, and I-94. This option is not relevant to the STEM OPT extension.\n    \n    -   **Option C**: This option states that the employer must sponsor the applicant and that the process can take years. However, this is not accurate for the STEM OPT extension. The employer does not need to sponsor the applicant, and the process typically takes several months, not years.\n    \n    -   **Option D**: This option directly addresses the STEM OPT extension, stating that if the applicant has a STEM-designated degree, they can apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension, making the total OPT period 36 months.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **Option D**. It accurately describes the requirements for applying for a STEM OPT extension, which includes having a STEM-designated degree and applying for a 24-month extension of the initial OPT period.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\" [D] \" [D] \" [D] \" [D]",

Remote work may be allowed if the employer has a U.S. presence and follows employment regulations.\n(C) You must apply for a Leave of Absence get DSO approval and may need to leave the U.S.\n(D) Typically no. Once you complete your coursework you are expected to apply for OPT instead.\n\nLet's analyze this step by step. First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe question is about the possibility of working remotely for a company based outside the U.S. while on CPT (Curricular Practical Training) or OPT (Optional Practical Training), which are types of work authorization for international students in the U.S.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluating Option A\nOption A suggests that working remotely for a company based outside the U.S. is possible while on CPT or OPT, but it requires DSO (Designated School Official) approval and may impact OPT eligibility if full-time CPT exceeds 12 months. This option seems plausible as it acknowledges the possibility of remote work with certain conditions.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Option B\nOption B states that generally, CPT and OPT require U.S.-based employment, but remote work may be allowed if the employer has a U.S. presence and follows employment regulations. This option also seems plausible as it suggests that remote work is possible under specific circumstances.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating Option C\nOption C suggests that to work remotely for a company based outside the U.S. while on CPT or OPT, one must apply for a Leave of Absence, get DSO approval, and may need to leave the U.S. This option seems less plausible as it implies a more complex and restrictive process.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating Option D\nOption D states that typically, no, one cannot work remotely for a company based outside the U.S. while on CPT or OPT, as one is expected to apply for OPT instead. This option seems less plausible as it does not account for the possibility of remote work.\n\n## Step 6: Selecting the Correct Answer\nBased on the analysis, Options A and B seem more plausible as they acknowledge the possibility of remote work while on CPT or OPT, albeit with certain conditions.

You can switch from OPT to H-1B while working. Your employer can file an H-1B petition for you while you are on OPT or STEM OPT. If approved, you may qualify for Cap-Gap Extension, allowing you to work until H-1B status begins. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it discusses filing Form I-765 online, which is unrelated to switching from OPT to H-1B while working. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because your DSO will not issue a new I-20 with CPT authorization every time you apply.

One of the benefits of the F-1 visa is the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows students to work in their field of study for up to 12 months after completing their degree. However, the F-1 visa itself has a limited duration, and students may need to extend their stay in the U.S. to complete their studies.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Yes, your employer can file an H-1B petition for you while you are on OPT or STEM OPT. If approved, you may qualify for Cap-Gap Extension allowing you to work until H-1B status begins. This option is correct because the H-1B petition can be filed while the student is on OPT or STEM OPT, and if approved, the Cap-Gap Extension can be applied for, allowing the student to work until the H-1B status begins.\n\n(B) No once your application is submitted you cannot change your requested start date. This option is incorrect because it is not relevant to the question of extending the F-1 visa while in the U.S.\n\n(C) No you must travel outside the U.S. to renew your F-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. This option is incorrect because it is not necessary to travel outside the U.S. to extend the F-1 visa. Students can extend their F-1 visa while in the U.S. by filing a request with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\n(D) Yes you get a new OPT period for each higher degree level (bachelors masters PhD). This option is incorrect because the OPT period is not extended for each higher degree level. The OPT period remains the same, regardless of the degree level.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) Yes, your employer can file an H-1B petition for you while you are on OPT or STEM OPT. If approved, you may qualify for Cap-Gap Extension allowing you to work until H-1B status begins. \n\nThis question requires the test-taker to have a good understanding of the F-1 visa and the OPT program, as well as the H-1B petition process and the Cap-Gap Extension.

Finally, choose the best answer based on your analysis.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding CPT and OPT\nCPT (Curricular Practical Training) and OPT (Optional Practical Training) are two types of work authorization for international students in the United States. CPT is a type of training that is an integral part of an established curriculum, while OPT is a type of work authorization that allows students to gain practical experience in their field of study after completing their degree.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluating Option A\nOption A states that you cannot be on CPT and OPT simultaneously. This is generally true because both CPT and OPT are forms of work authorization, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not allow students to engage in both types of training at the same time.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Option B\nOption B mentions that you can apply for OPT up to 90 days before graduation and up to 60 days after graduation. This is a correct statement regarding the timing of OPT applications, but it does not address the question of whether CPT and OPT can be done simultaneously.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating Option C\nOption C suggests that common options include H-1B, O-1, or L-1 visas. These are all types of non-immigrant work visas, but they are not relevant to the question of whether CPT and OPT can be done at the same time.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating Option D\nOption D states that yes, you can do CPT and OPT, but you need DSO (Designated School Official) approval and it may impact your OPT eligibility if full-time CPT exceeds 12 months. This option is the most relevant to the question, as it acknowledges that CPT and OPT can be done at the same time, but with certain conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Choosing the Best Answer\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is Option D, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which CPT and OPT can be done simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\"(D)\"(D)The final answer is: $\\boxed{(D",

CPT is a type of work authorization for F-1 students that allows them to engage in off-campus work related to their field of study.\n\nOption (A) states that yes, it is possible to do multiple CPTs with different employers, but each CPT requires separate approval from the school and must be related to the degree program. This option seems plausible because it aligns with the purpose of CPT, which is to provide F-1 students with practical work experience related to their field of study.\n\nOption (B) discusses Optional Practical Training (OPT), which is a different type of work authorization for F-1 students. OPT allows students to engage in off-campus work related to their field of study after completing their degree program. This option is not relevant to the question about CPT.\n\nOption (C) states that you must be in good academic standing to apply for CPT, which is a requirement for CPT eligibility. However, this option does not address the question of whether it is possible to do multiple CPTs with different employers.\n\nOption (D) states that you must wait until you receive your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card and reach the start date before engaging in CPT. This option is not relevant to the question of whether it is possible to do multiple CPTs with different employers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (A), which states that yes, it is possible to do multiple CPTs with different employers, but each CPT requires separate approval from the school and must be related to the degree program. This option aligns with the purpose of CPT and the requirements for CPT eligibility. \n\nThe final answer is (A). \n\nNote: The analysis is based on the assumption that the question is referring to Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and not Optional Practical Training (OPT).

This is correct because if an F-1 student's OPT is terminated or expires, they may need to apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. immediately.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption (C) states that yes, but if you do 12 months of full-time CPT you lose eligibility for OPT. This is incorrect because completing 12 months of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) does not affect eligibility for OPT.\n\nStep 5: Select the best answer\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is option (B).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$ nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan\n\nBased on the above, reasoning what is the single, most likely answer choice? \nAnswer using this format:\n[X]\n\nPlease reply only with the correct option, do not say anything else.\"B\" nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan",

First, understand the question. Next, evaluate each option in short (2-5) lines each. Also, you can generate up to 512 tokens to reason. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the requirements for filing Form I-765 online. Form I-765 is an application for Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which is a document that allows certain non-citizens to work in the United States. When filing Form I-765 online, the applicant must provide certain documents to support their eligibility for an EAD.\n\nOption (A) states that you must provide personal details, eligibility category, and supporting documents. While personal details and eligibility category are required, this option does not specifically mention the requirement for supporting documents.\n\nOption (B) mentions that during the online application process, you will be prompted to upload digital copies of your supporting documents. This option is partially correct but does not provide a comprehensive list of required documents.\n\nOption (C) discusses CPT (Curricular Practical Training) authorizations, which is unrelated to the requirements for filing Form I-765 online.\n\nOption (D) provides a comprehensive list of required documents when filing Form I-765 online, including a completed Form I-765, supporting evidence specific to the eligibility category, a digital passport-style photo, and payment for the applicable fee. This option accurately reflects the requirements for filing Form I-765 online.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) When filing Form I-765 online you should prepare the following:\n\nA completed Form I-765\n\nSupporting evidence specific to your eligibility category\n\nA digital passport-style photo\n\nPayment for the applicable fee.\n\nThe final answer is (D). \n\nNote: This response is based on the assumption that the question is referring to the requirements for filing Form I-765 online with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
