## Form Details
04/01/24 . You can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.
Dates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.
If you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are missing or are from a different form edition, we may reject your form.
If you need help downloading and printing forms, read our instructions .
You generally have 2 options for filing your Form N-400 with USCIS:
- Online; or
- By mail (paper).
Filing Your Form N-400 Online
You must create a USCIS online account to file your Form N-400 online . Having an online account will also allow you to:
- Pay your filing fee online;
- Check the status of your case;
- Receive notifications and case updates;
- View personalized case completion date estimates;
- Respond to requests for evidence; and
- Manage your contact information, including updating your address.
Attorneys and accredited representatives: You may also create an online account, which will allow you to manage all your clients’ applications in one place.
You cannot file online if you are requesting a fee waiver or a reduced fee; you must file a paper Form N-400.
Filing Your Form N-400 by Mail
If you submit Form N-400 on paper, we will mail you a USCIS Account Acceptance Notice with instructions on how to create an online account to track and manage your case. We will process your application even if you do not create an online account, but we encourage you to create and access your online account. We will continue to mail you copies of notifications about your case. Please check our Direct Filing Addresses for Form N-400 page for information on where to mail your application. Applications that are not submitted to the appropriate direct filing address may experience processing delays.
You may file Form N-400, Application for Naturalization , 90 calendar days before you complete your continuous residence requirement if your eligibility for naturalization is based upon being a:
- Permanent resident for at least 5 years; or
- Permanent resident for at least 3 years if you are married to a US citizen.
Please see our USCIS Early Filing Calculator page for additional information.
You can find the filing fee for Form N-400 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.
If you file your Form N-400 by mail (paper), you can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, or cashier’s check or by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.
Did you know? USCIS will automatically extend the validity of your Permanent Resident Card (commonly called a Green Card) for up to 24 months after you properly apply for naturalization. This update is expected to help naturalization applicants who experience longer processing times, because they will receive this automatic extension of lawful permanent resident status and may not need to file Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). See more information here .
Please do not submit this checklist with your Form N-400. The checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. We recommend that you review these requirements before completing and submitting your form. Do not send original documents unless specifically requested in the form instructions or applicable regulations.
If you submit any documents (copies or original documents, if requested) in a foreign language, you must include a full English translation along with a certification from the translator verifying that the translation is complete and accurate, and that the translator is competent to translate from the foreign language into English.

Filing Tips: Review our Tips for Filing Forms by Mail page for information on how to ensure we will accept your form.
Don’t forget to sign your form. We will reject any unsigned form.
- Biometrics: Applicants who file Form N-400 must generally submit biometrics unless we waive the requirement. An applicant who is required to appear at an application support center (ASC) to submit biometrics will receive a notice of their scheduled appointment. If we determine you are eligible for naturalization, we may use the photograph taken at the ASC on your Certificate of Naturalization. Therefore, we recommend that, on the day of your ASC appointment, you dress in clothing that is acceptable for display on your Certificate of Naturalization. We will not reject a photograph based solely on your desire to modify the photograph shown on your certificate.
- Photographs: Based on processing needs, you may need to submit physical passport photographs after you have already filed your Form N-400. We will send you a request for physical photographs with instructions on how to submit them.
- Attorney or representative: You may be represented, at no expense to the U.S. government, by an attorney or other duly authorized or accredited representative. Your representative must submitForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, with your Form N-400. They may also submit Form G-28 at the time of your interview.
- Lost or Expiring Permanent Resident Card (Green Card):Effective Dec. 12, 2022, after you properly file Form N-400, you will receive a Form N-400 receipt notice that automatically extends your Green Card for 2 years from the “Card Expires” date on your Green Card. This notice will serve as proof that we have extended your Green Card, which is evidence of your lawful permanent resident status. The notice should be presented together with your Green Card. If you lose your Green Card, you generally must still file Form I-90 even if you have applied for naturalization. If you have a Form N-400 receipt notice that automatically extends the validity of your Green Card, but your notice has been destroyed or lost, then you generally must file Form I-90 to renew your expiring Green Card.
## Biometrics for Service Members
We will review your application and conduct required background and security checks, which may include you providing us with your fingerprints. This can be done in 1 of these ways:
- If you were fingerprinted for a previous immigration application, we will use these fingerprints, if available.
- If you are stationed outside the United States, you may submit 2 properly completed FD-258 fingerprint cards and 2 passport-style photos taken by the military police or officials with the Department of Homeland Security at a U.S. embassy or U.S. consulate.
