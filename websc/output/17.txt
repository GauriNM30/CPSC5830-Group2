## Designated School Official Annual Verification Period
As part of the ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act, Principal Designated School Officials (PDSOs) and Designated School Officials (DSOs) at SEVP-certified institutions are required to complete an annual verification process in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). This process is essential for confirming that all individuals who access SEVIS are still employed by their respective institutions, remain active in their roles and require continued access to the system. Institutions are encouraged to begin the verification process early to ensure that all DSOs and PDSOs are properly verified within the required timeframe.
Key Dates:
- Verification start date: December 2, 2024
- Verification end date: March 2, 2025
Verification Requirements:
DSOs must log into SEVIS and verify that all personnel within their institution are authorized to access the system, meeting the following criteria:
- Are currently employed by the institution
- Are still active in their roles as DSOs
- Require continued access to SEVIS
Verification Instructions:
For guidance on completing the verification, please consult the PDSO/DSO Annual Verification article available on the SEVIS Help Hub .
Consequences for Failure to Complete Verification: Failure to complete the annual verification by March 2, 2025 may result in the following consequences:
- Loss of access to SEVIS
- Loss of batch access
- Possible compliance action
For additional details or assistance, please refer to the full Broadcast Message available on ICE.gov/SEVP .
