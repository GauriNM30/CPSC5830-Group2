## I-730,Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition
ALERT : Effective May 6, 2024, all Form I-730 following to join refugee (FTJ-R) petitions are being processed at the USCIS International Operations Division rather than the Asylum Vetting Center. We shifted this workload to better serve Form I-730 petitioners and beneficiaries by establishing a dedicated team with primary responsibility for initial domestic processing of FTJ-R petitions. This will help us process this critical family reunification program more efficiently.
We will automatically transfer any pending Form I-730 FTJ-R petitions filed by refugee petitioners from the Asylum Vetting Center to USCIS International Operations and send the petitioner a transfer notice. If you have a pending Form I-730 FTJ-R petition, please refer to the transfer notice you receive for more information about the transfer of your petition. Please note, USCIS International Operations is not open to the public and does not accept requests or inquiries made in person.
Because the Asylum Vetting Center no longer completes initial domestic processing of Form I-730 FTJ-R petitions, the Asylum Vetting Center cannot respond to any Form I-730 FTJ-R inquiries. Please do not go to or make inquiries at the Asylum Vetting Center or any asylum office because office staff are not able to receive or respond to any Form I-730 inquiries.
REMINDER: Please submit a passport-style photograph or a recently taken clear photograph of each family member you are petitioning for. If you do not provide the required photo, we may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE), and it could take longer to process your petition.
If you are a principal refugee admitted to the United States within the past 2 years or a principal asylee who was granted asylum within the past 2 years, you (the petitioner) may use this form to request that your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age (the beneficiaries) join you in the United States. In certain circumstances, unmarried children over 21 years old may be eligible for following-to-join immigration benefits. For more information, see our Child Status Protection Act page. In some cases, we may grant a waiver of the 2-year filing deadline for humanitarian reasons. See the Instructions for Form I-730 for more information.
The processing of Form I-730 petitions depends on various factors, including your status as a principal asylee or refugee and the current location of your beneficiary. Form I-730 processing is divided into three steps:
1. Receipt and Initial Domestic Processing;
2. Beneficiary Interview and Additional Processing; and
3. Department of State Returns (as appropriate).
Receipt and Initial Domestic Processing
The Service Center Operations Directorate (SCOPS) receives all Form I-730 petitions. SCOPS performs initial domestic processing of Form I-730 following-to-join asylee (FTJ-A) petitions. The Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate (RAIO) performs initial domestic processing of Form I-730 following-to-join refugee (FTJ-R) petitions at USCIS International Operations. Generally, USCIS processes Form I-730 petitions in the order we receive them.
If we need additional evidence, we will issue you a request for evidence (RFE) and give you an opportunity to respond.
Beneficiary Interview and Additional Processing
Once we complete initial domestic processing of your Form I-730 petition, and if we determine that your relative appears eligible as a follow-to-join asylee or refugee, we will send your petition to the appropriate office to interview your spouse or child and continue processing. After receiving your petition, the interviewing office will notify you, your spouse or child, and any representative of record, and provide additional instructions.
If the beneficiary is located within the United States , we will forward the petition to the appropriate USCIS domestic field office based on the beneficiary’s residence. We will send you a transfer notice listing the USCIS field office. You can find more information on USCIS domestic field offices on the USCIS Field Offices page.
If the beneficiary is located outside of the United States , we will forward the petition through the Department of State’s (DOS) National Visa Center (NVC) to a USCIS international field oﬀice or a U.S. embassy or consulate with jurisdiction over the beneficiary’s residence.
If your beneficiary is located outside of the United States in a country where USCIS has an international field office with jurisdiction over the country where your beneficiary lives , your beneficiary will be interviewed by USCIS. You will receive a transfer notice listing the USCIS international field office that will interview your beneficiary and complete processing. Currently, USCIS maintains international field offices in Bangladesh, China, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Mexico, Qatar, and Turkey. Please note that the USCIS Nairobi Field Office also processes Form I-730 following-to-join refugee petitions for beneficiaries located in Burundi and Uganda. You can find information about USCIS international offices on the USCIS International Immigration Offices page.
If your beneficiary is located outside of the United States in a country with no USCIS international field office presence or jurisdiction , a DOS embassy or consulate will interview and complete processing of your beneficiary on USCIS’ behalf and will determine your beneficiary’s eligibility to travel to the United States. If your beneficiary will be interviewed at a DOS embassy or consulate, you will receive an approval notice from USCIS after initial domestic processing of your petition is complete. You can find more information about U.S. embassies and consulates on the DOS U.S. Embassy Locator page, which also includes details on whether the U.S. embassy or consulate is open for interviews and additional processing.
Department of State Returns
If DOS interviews and processes the beneficiary outside the United States and finds a basis for ineligibility, DOS will return the petition to the domestic USCIS processing component for further review of the decision. We will then review the Form I-730 petition and may re-open the petition and request additional information, deny the petition, or reaffirm the petition and return it to DOS for continued processing.

Following-to-Join Refugee (FTJ-R) Petitions Only
On Feb. 1, 2018, USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) implemented procedures requiring additional information for FTJ-R beneficiaries to determine eligibility. You should submit a Form I-590, Registration for Classification as Refugee (PDF, 691.55 KB) , for your FTJ-R relative along with the Form I-730 petition; your relative does not need to complete Parts 5 or 8 or sign the Form I-590. We will not deny a Form I-730 that does not have a Form I-590, but we will request this information from petitioners if they do not submit it.
You cannot use Form I-590 to request refugee status directly with USCIS. For information about the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, see our Refugees page.
Change of Address
It is important to notify USCIS or DOS if your contact information or your beneficiary’s contact information changes.
- Please go touscis.gov/addresschangefor information on how to change your address with USCIS.
- If your beneficiary is located outside the United States and a USCIS international field office will interview and process them, email the USCIS international field office if the beneficiary’s contact information changes from what is on their Form I-730. You can find contact information at theUSCIS International Immigration Officespage.
- If your beneficiary is located outside of the United States and a U.S. embassy or consulate will interview and process them, contact theNational Visa Centerand the U.S. embassy or consulate. Find contact information for U.S. embassies and consulates at theDOS U.S. Embassy Locatorpage.
Form I-730 Beneficiaries Located Outside the United States Where There is No U.S. Government Presence
USCIS is working closely with DOS to identify how to process Form I-730 petitions in locations outside the United States where there is not a U.S. government presence. If your beneficiary previously resided in a country without a U.S. government presence but has left that country, please update their address information, using the instructions above, so either USCIS or DOS can process them in a third country.
Outside of Normal Processing Times Inquiry
If the most recent notice you received indicated that a USCIS office is processing your Form I-730 petition, and it is taking longer than the normal processing times listed for Form I-730 petitions on our Processing Times page, you may submit an “outside of normal processing times” inquiry for your pending Form I-730 petition.
- For Form I-730 petitions being processed by the HART Service Center, the USCIS International Operations domestic office, or a domestic field office, you may call theUSCIS Contact Centerand submit a case inquiry. Please note that the USCIS International Operations domestic office is not a public-facing office and does not accept requests or inquiries made in person.
- For Form I-730 petitions pending at a USCIS international field office outside the United States, please call theUSCIS Contact Centeror email the USCIS international office processing your petition. You can find contact information for international offices at theUSCIS International Immigration Officespage.
- USCIS does not have processing time information for Form I-730 petitions pending with DOS. For Form I-730 petitions being processed by a U.S. embassy or consulate, see theDepartment of State U.S. Embassy Locatorpage for contact information.
Note: USCIS asylum offices do not have information about pending Form I-730 petitions and do not accept requests or inquiries about Form I-730 petitions. You should not visit a USCIS asylum office in person or contact any USCIS asylum office for inquiries or requests on Form I-730 petitions.
Expedite Requests
For information on making an expedite request for USCIS processing, please refer to our How to Make an Expedite Request page, which includes information on expedite criteria. Because granting an expedite request means that we would adjudicate that requestor's benefit before others who filed earlier, we carefully weigh the urgency and merit of each expedite request. If your situation matches any of the USCIS expedite criteria, you have already filed your Form I-730 petition with USCIS, and you would like to request expedited processing, please check the most recent notice you have received and use the chart below to submit your expedite request to the USCIS office processing your petition.
Please refer to your latest receipt notice or case transfer notice from USCIS.
Corrections to Submitted Form I-730 Petitions
If you have filed your Form I-730 petition and need to update information or make changes to the petition, call the USCIS Contact Center . Please have your most recent receipt or transfer notice available when you call the USCIS Contact Center.
