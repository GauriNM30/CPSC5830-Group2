## I-485,Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status
ALERT: Effective January 22, 2025, USCIS waives any and all requirements that applicants for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident present documentation on their Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, that they received the COVID-19 vaccination. USCIS will not issue any Request for Evidence (RFE) or Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) related to proving a COVID-19 vaccination. USCIS will not deny any adjustment of status application based on the applicant’s failure to present documentation that they received the COVID-19 vaccination.
ALERT: On Dec. 10, 2024, we published a new edition of Form I-485, which included updated questions and instructions. Starting Feb 10, 2025, we will only accept the 10/24/24 edition of Form I-485 and will reject any older editions of Form I-485 postmarked on or after Feb 10, 2025.
Effective Dec. 2, 2024, if you are required to submit Form I-693, or a partial Form I-693 (such as the Vaccination Record), you must submit it with your Form I-485. Otherwise, we may reject your Form I-485.
ALERT: Effective April 4, 2024, any Form I-693 that was properly completed and signed by a civil surgeon on or after Nov. 1, 2023, does not expire, and can be used indefinitely as evidence to show that the applicant is not inadmissible on health-related grounds. For more information, see the Form I-693 Instructions and Policy Alert .
ALERT: Below are ways you can help prevent an unnecessary delay in the adjudication of your Form I-485:
- File all required initial evidence, including Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (if applicable), and supporting documentation as described in the form instructions. You may use the Checklist of Required Initial Evidence as an optional resource; and
- Use the current edition for Form I-485.
If you are required to submit a Form I-693, or a partial Form I-693 (such as the Vaccination Record), you must submit it with your Form I-485. Otherwise, your Form I-485 may be rejected. If you are required to submit a Form I-693, we cannot approve your Form I-485 without a valid Form I-693.
Submitting all required initial evidence and supporting documentation at the same time you file Form I-485 will help avoid rejection of your Form I-485 or the need for us to issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) to obtain additional that evidence and supporting documentation, which may further delay adjudication of your case.
Use this form to apply for lawful permanent resident status if you are in the United States.
## Forms and Document Downloads
## Form Details
10/24/24 . Starting Feb. 10, 2025, we will accept only the 10/24/24 edition. Until then, you can also use the 08/28/24 M and 08/28/24 editions. You can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.
Dates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.
If you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are missing or are from a different form edition, we may reject your form.
If you need help downloading and printing forms, read our instructions .
Where you file your Form I-485 depends on your eligibility category. Go to our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-485 page to see where you should file your application.
If you file at a USCIS lockbox, you may not receive an A-Number on your Form I-797, Notice of Action, due to a change in our business process. In these cases, we will send your A-Number in a second notice a few days after accepting your application.
In general, you may not file your Form I-485 until an immigrant visa is immediately available in your category. For information on the process of adjusting status as a permanent resident, and how to determine whether and when you are eligible to adjust status and file Form I-485, see our Visa Availability and Priority Dates and Adjustment of Status Filing Charts from the Visa Bulletin pages. For exceptions to the visa availability requirement, please check the Form I-485 instructions for your specific immigrant category for additional information.
You can find the filing fee for Form I-485 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.
You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier's check, or pay by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.
Save time by submitting all required initial evidence and supporting documentation at the same time you file Form I-485.
View the checklist of required initial evidence.
The checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form, but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. Submitting all required initial evidence and supporting documentation at the same time you file Form I-485 may eliminate the need for us to issue a Request for Evidence to obtain additional documentation and evidence. This may also help avoid adjudication delays if we decide that you do not need to be interviewed.
If you are required to submit Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, or a partial Form I-693 (such as the Vaccination Record), you must submit it with your Form I-485. Otherwise, we may reject your Form I-485.
Effective April 4, 2024, any Form I-693 that was properly completed and signed by a civil surgeon on or after Nov. 1, 2023, does not expire, and can be used indefinitely as evidence to show that the applicant is not inadmissible on health-related grounds.
Filing Tips: Review our Tips for Filing Forms by Mail page for information on how to ensure we will accept your form.
Don’t forget to sign your form. We will reject any unsigned form.
E-Notification : If you want to receive an e-mail and/or text message that we have accepted your form at a USCIS lockbox, complete Form G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance , and clip it to the first page of your form.

Filing Form I-765 and Form I-131 with Form I-485
If you filed Form I-485 on or after July 30, 2007, and before April 1, 2024, and paid the required fee, you do not have to pay an additional fee to also file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , or Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records . However, if you file Form I-485 after April 1, 2024, you must pay additional fees to file Form I-765 and Form I-131, as listed on our Fee Schedule page. In either case, you may file these forms concurrently.
If you file Form I-131 concurrently with Form I-485 or while Form I-485 is pending and are requesting an advance parole document, select only item 5. A. in Part 1 of Form I-131.

If you choose not to file Form I-765 and/or Form I-131 concurrently with your Form I-485, then you must submit a copy of your Form I-797C, Notice of Action , also known as your receipt, as evidence that you filed Form I-485 when you file Form I-765 and/or Form I-131.
