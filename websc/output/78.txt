## I-821,Application for Temporary Protected Status
If you believe you are an eligible national of a designated country or person without nationality who last habitually resided in the designated country, use this form to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). When filing an initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Request for Employment Authorization, when you file Form I-821.
You may also file your Form I-765 request separately at a later date.

## Form Details
04/01/24 . You can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.
Dates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.
If you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are missing or are from a different form edition, we may reject your form.
If you need help downloading and printing forms, read our instructions .
All applicants eligible to file for TPS under one of the current designations may file Form I-821 online. For more information, please see our TPS page.
If you choose to mail a paper application, use the corresponding address listed on the TPS page.
All TPS applicants should wait to file their Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, until publication of the Federal Register notice for their respective TPS country.
If you are applying for TPS for the first time, you must register for TPS during the registration period set in the Federal Register notice announcing the initial designation or re-designation of your country for TPS. If you wish to maintain your existing TPS, you must re-register for TPS during the re-registration period set in the Federal Register notice announcing the extension of your country designation for TPS.
For information about when you must file your TPS application, please refer to the country-specific pages found on the left of the Temporary Protected Status page. The Temporary Protected Status page also provides details regarding when or how you may be eligible to file late.
You can find the filing fee for Form I-821 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.
You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.
Please do not submit this checklist with your Form I-821. The checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form, but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. We recommend that you review these requirements before completing and submitting your form. Do not send original documents unless specifically requested in the form instructions or applicable regulations.
If you submit any documents (copies or original documents, if requested) in a foreign language, you must include a full English translation along with a certification from the translator verifying that the translation is complete and accurate, and that they are competent to translate from the foreign language into English.
Did you provide the following?
- Evidence to prove your identity and nationality;
- Evidence to prove your date of entry into the United States;
- Evidence to prove your residence in the United States; and
- Court disposition records (if you were ever arrested, charged, or convicted for a criminal offense).
