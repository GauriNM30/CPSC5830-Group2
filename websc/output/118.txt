Related Tags: SEVIS
## Initial Certification
Only schools certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) can enroll F or M non-immigrant students. A school applies for SEVP-certification to enroll F and/or M students by completing the Form I-17, “Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student,” online using the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and pays all required fees online at Pay.gov.
## Filing Documents
SEVP requires schools to electronically submit the minimum required evidence at the same time it submits the petition in SEVIS. The petitioning school submits the required evidence and their record is marked as “filed” in SEVIS upon receipt of documents and proof of payment.
## Site Visit
The petitioning school will undergo a site visit from an SEVP site inspector within 20 days of the date the school is marked “filed” in SEVIS. During the site visit, the inspector will gather evidence on school eligibility for certification, review the facilities and interview personnel nominated on the petition to become designated school officials, known as DSOs, including the person nominated to be principal designated school official, known as PDSOs.
## Adjudication
The petitioning school’s Form I-17 and supporting documentation will be reviewed by an SEVP adjudicator to determine the school’s eligibility for SEVP certification. The SEVP adjudicator may send the petitioning school additional requests for evidence if more information is needed to complete the adjudication.
## Notice of Decision
Once a decision is made about the school’s petition for SEVP-certification, DSOs from the petitioning school will receive a notification from SEVIS that details SEVP’s adjudication decision.
## Issuance of Forms I-20
Once certified by SEVP, DSOs at the SEVP-certified school can now issue Forms I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status” to F and M nonimmigrant students who have been accepted into their school. Nonimmigrant students use the Form I-20 to apply for their student visa from the U.S. Department of State.
## Updates to Form I-17 and Adjudication
SEVP-certified institutions are required to keep all Form I-17 sections up to date in order to ensure the Form I-17 reflects the institution’s current operating status. Any changes to the information on the Form I-17 or the program of study listed on it require an update to the form within 21 days of the change. Schools must submit evidence as part of filing the update.
## Recertification
SEVP-certified schools must go through a Congressionally mandated recertification process every two years. During this process, SEVP reviews a school’s record keeping to verify that it continues to be a bona fide school and remains compliant with SEVP regulatory standards. SEVIS will notify all DSOs of their school’s certification expiration date (CED). The CED is the last date your school will be eligible to enroll F and/or M students unless a complete recertification package is submitted within the appropriate timeframe. The PDSO must submit a complete recertification package to SEVP within 180 days of the CED.
