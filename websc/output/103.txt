## Review These Reminders About Program End Dates
At the beginning of a new school session, designated school officials (DSOs) and students should consider the program end dates (PEDs) on the Form I-20, “Certificates of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” Students should, if necessary, request an extension before the current program end date has passed .
Best Practices for Students
Make sure you have a copy of your latest Form I-20 to keep track of your PED. If you are unsure whether you have your latest Form I-20 or if your PED is correct, talk to your DSO.
Best Practices for DSOs
Before you submit an F-1 or M-1 student’s extension request, it is best practice to:
- Obtain an explanation from the student’s advisor/instructor for the extension and the new PED.
- Obtain current financial documentation showing enough funds to pay tuition and living expenses for the student and any dependents.
- UpdateFinancial Informationin the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
It is also a best practice to issue an updated Form I-20 when the information on the Form I-20 changes. It is important for the student to receive the updated Form I-20. The Form I-20 is the only place a student sees the updated PED. Students are expected to keep all Forms I-20 issued during their academic career.
See these resources for additional information about program dates:

- [F-1] Extension of Stay: 8 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 214.2(f)(7)
Common Reasons for Updated PED

- DSO entered the wrong dates.
- Student’s application to change status to F or M status is still pending with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
- Student completed the program of study before the anticipated program end date.
- Student is in a master’s or doctorate program, has completed all in-class course work, and has requested post-completion optional practical training (OPT) while working on a thesis or dissertation.
