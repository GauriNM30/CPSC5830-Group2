## Naturalization Through Military Service
If you are serving or have served in the U.S. armed forces and are interested in becoming a U.S. citizen, you may be eligible to apply for naturalization under special provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).
Check Eligibility
If you meet all the requirements of either section 328 or 329 of the INA, you may apply for naturalization by filing Form N-400, Application for Naturalization , under the section that applies to you. You will not have to pay any fees for applying for naturalization under INA 328 or 329. As a current or former member of the U.S. military, certain other naturalization requirements may not apply to you; for example, if you served honorably during a designated period of hostilities, you may not have to reside in or be physically present in the U.S. for any length of time before you apply for naturalization. The requirements for naturalization are explained in greater detail below.
If you served honorably in the U.S. armed forces for at least one year at any time, you may be eligible to apply for naturalization. While some general naturalization requirements apply under INA 328, other requirements may not apply or are reduced. To establish eligibility under INA 328, you must:

- Have served honorably at any time in the U.S. armed forces for a period or periods totaling at least 1 year;

- Demonstrate that if separated from service, you were separated under honorable conditions;
- Be a lawful permanent resident at the time of your naturalization interview;

Many military installations have a designated USCIS liaison to help you with the naturalization application process. These liaisons are typically assigned to a specific office (for example, your installation’s community service center, DOS family liaison office or Judge Advocate General). If you are currently serving, ask your chain of command to certify your honorable military service on Form N-426, Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service. If you have already separated from the U.S. armed forces, you must submit a photocopy of your DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, NGB Form 22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service, or other official discharge document for all periods of service. Mail your completed application and all required materials to:
USCIS P.O. Box 4446 Chicago, IL 60680-4446
You may also complete your application by creating an online account and filing your Form N-400 online. For more information about filing your application online, visit our Form N-400 webpage.
We will review your application and conduct required security checks, which include obtaining your fingerprints. This can be done in one of the following ways:
- If you were fingerprinted for a previous immigration application, we will use these fingerprints, if available.
- If residing or stationed abroad, you may submit two properly completed FD-258 fingerprint cards and two passport-style photos taken by the military police or officials with the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. embassy, or U.S. consulate.
- You may go to an application support center (ASC) in the United States and submit your fingerprints. If you are a current or former service member, we allow you to submit your fingerprints at an ASC before you file your Form N-400. Be sure to include your A-Number. Please be sure to bring evidence of your prior or current military service, such as, but not limited to your military ID, official orders, enlistment contract and/or discharge documents.
- If you have questions regarding your biometrics, you can contact theMilitary Help Lineat 877-CIS-4MIL (877-247-4645, if you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability, please dial 711 to access telecommunications relay services). Our representatives are available to answer calls Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, excluding federal holidays.
We will review your application and send it to a USCIS field office to schedule you for an interview. You can request an interview at a specific office in a cover letter attached to your application or leave the choice of location to us.
The field office will schedule your interview to review your eligibility for naturalization and test your knowledge of English and civics. If we find that you are eligible for naturalization, we will inform you of the date you can take the Oath of Allegiance and become a U.S. citizen.
You must complete and submit:
- N-400, Application for Naturalization; andIf currently serving,N-426, Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service. The military must certify this form before you send it to us; orIf you are separated from the military, you must submit a photocopy of your DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, NGB Form 22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service, or other official discharge document for all periods of service.

If you are applying for naturalization based on former military service, you must complete your naturalization interview and take the Oath of Allegiance in the United States. If you are residing outside of the United States and are unable to enter the United States with a visa, you may request parole by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, concurrently with your N-400 application. See Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole for Individuals Outside the United States and Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records for additional information. Write "Military N-400" at the top of Form I-131.
Where to File
See the “Advance Parole Document for current and former service members outside of the U.S.” section of our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records page. Do not submit the I-131 separately.

Generally, individuals who served honorably in an active-duty status in the U.S. armed forces during a specified period of military hostilities and died as a result of injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by that service may be eligible for posthumous citizenship under section 329A of the INA.
You must file Form N-644, Application for Posthumous Citizenship ,
on behalf of the deceased service member within two years of their death. Upon approving the application, we will issue a Certificate of Citizenship in the name of the deceased service member establishing posthumously that they were a U.S. citizen on the date they died.
Other provisions of the law may extend immigration benefits to the service member’s surviving spouse, children, and parents. For information, see the Family Based Survivor Benefits page.
Before your naturalization interview, be sure to study for the English and civics test by using our free resources to help you prepare.
Find study materials for the English and civics tests on the Study for the Test page.
