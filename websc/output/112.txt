## Overview
Off-campus employment is a benefit available for some F-1 students who are:
- Experiencing an economic hardship.
- Seeking special student relief due to emergent circumstances.
- Participating in an internship with an international organization.
A designated school official (DSO) must verify that the student qualifies for off-campus employment by entering the employment information in SEVIS.
Off-campus employment recommendations cannot exceed one year; except for employment during Special Student Relief (SSR), which can end either on the last date of the authorized SSR, as published in the Federal Register notice, or the student’s program end date, whichever is earlier.
The student must then file a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
Remind your F-1 students:
- Not to file the Form I-765, “Application for Employment Authorization,” until you have recommended off-campus employment in their SEVIS records, and they have the updated Form I-20 with the off-campus employment recommendation.
If a student submits the Form I-765 on paper or electronically before you recommend the off-campus employment:
- USCIS will deny the application. (Federal regulations require the DSO off- campus recommendation on the student SEVIS record before the Form I- 765 is submitted.)
- The student will have to reapply for off-campus employment and pay the fee again, if required.
IMPORTANT: Making these mistakes can dramatically delay the final USCIS authorized employment start date.
- 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii)– Off-campus work authorization
- 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(iii)– Internship with an international organization
## Severe Economic Hardship
The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) defines “severe economic hardship” as a financial condition caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student’s control that make it difficult for a student to continue education in the United States.
These financial conditions may include:
- Loss of financial aid or on-campus employment through no fault of the student.
- Substantial changes in the exchange rate or value of the currency upon which the student depends.
- Inordinate increases in tuition or living costs.
- Unexpected changes in the financial state of the student’s source of support.
- Medical bills.
- Other substantial and unexpected expenses.
8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii)(C) – Severe economic hardship
To qualify for off-campus employment, the student must be able to demonstrate why on-campus employment is unavailable or insufficient to meet the student’s financial needs, which arise from unexpected circumstances.
## Special Student Relief Due to Emergent Circumstances
In special global circumstances (e.g., famine, war, economic downturn, etc.) the U.S. government may allow students from affected countries temporary special benefits. This practice is called Special Student Relief (SSR). One of the SSR benefits is to apply for off-campus employment. In these cases, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will issue a notice in the Federal Register that gives timelines and details of the benefits.
For more information about SSR, see:
- What is Special Student Relief and Frequently Asked Questions
- What is Special Student Relief Fact Sheet
- Special Student Relief Criteria
- List of Special Student Relief Federal Register notices(scroll to middle of page)
## Internship with an International Organization
Students who are offered an internship with an international organization may be eligible for an employment benefit. The internship must:
- Be in the United States.
- Be with a public international organization that falls within the International Organization Immunities Act, as defined in 22 U.S.C. § 28859 Stat. 669.
8 CFR 316.20(c) – International Organizations Immunities Act designations
