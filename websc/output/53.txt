## Report Immigration Scams
Have you been a victim of an immigration services scam, and need to find help? Use this page to learn how and where to report immigration scams.
Reporting scams will not affect your immigration application or petition.
Please help stop the unauthorized practice of immigration law by standing up to scammers and reporting them. Also, many states allow you to report scams anonymously.
## How to Report Immigration Scams
Report the scam to your state consumer protection office . See the table below for state-specific information.
If you lost money or other possessions in a scam, report it to your local police, too. To learn more about where to report fraud and scams, visit USA.gov’s Common Scams and Frauds webpage.
You can always report scams to the Federal Trade Commission . In the table below, we've included information on where to report scams in your state and links to the laws that protect you as a consumer.
## Scam Websites and Social Media Accounts
Some websites and social media accounts claim to be affiliated with USCIS and offer step-by-step guidance on completing a USCIS application or petition. To report a website or social media account that claims to be affiliated with USCIS, send an email to uscis.webmaster@uscis.dhs.gov .
