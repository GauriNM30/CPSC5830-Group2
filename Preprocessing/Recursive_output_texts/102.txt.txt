- F-1 Optional Practical Training
- View Employment Information
## Regulations and Policy
Complex rules apply to CPT because the training opportunity must comply with both:
- Federal regulations
- School policies regarding internships, experiential learning, etc.
Designated school officials must understand the following federal regulations and policy guidance to determine if a student qualifies for CPT:
Regulations applicable to CPT:
- 8 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 214.2(f)(10)and (f)(10(i)
-  Training page on ICE.gov
## Eligibility
A DSO can authorize CPT for an F-1 student enrolled at an SEVP-certified college, university, conservatory, or seminary if the student:
- Has been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for at least a full academic year.Note:An exception exists for students in graduate studies whose programs require earlier training.
- Is not studying English as a second language.
- Has secured a training position.
CPT authorization is only required when the training is inside the United States. For example, a summer internship in a student’s home country does not need CPT authorization.
## CPT Process Overview
- Requests CPT using the school’s established processes.
- Reviews request and determines student’s eligibility for CPT.
- Authorizes CPT in SEVIS for a specific employer.
