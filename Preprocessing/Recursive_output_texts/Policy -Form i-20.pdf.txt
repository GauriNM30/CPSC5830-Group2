SEVP Policy Guidance: Form I-20 Issuance and School Use of Recruiters
Primary Regulation: 8 CFR 2/4.3(&)
Date: June 4, 2019
Issue:
‘The Form 1-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” is issued to
‘nonimmigrant students who have been accepted for enrollment at a U.S, educational institution
certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The document is critically
‘important to nonimmigrant students who must present it when applying fora visa and when
seeking admission to the United States. In that context, SEVP has been asked whether recruiters
may receive the Form I-20 directly from a school’s designated school official (DSO) and control
the distribution to the prospective student. For reasons of privacy, security and fraud prevention,
the Form 1-20 must be issued directly by a school to the nonimmigrant student, his or her
dependents, or, for minors, to the parent or guardian ofthe nonimmigrant student.
Background:
‘The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was created as part of a
legislative mandate to collect and maintain information on nonimmigrant students who enter the
United States on F, M or J nonimmigrant visas. SEVIS is classified asa system of records, for
which the Privacy Act requires U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to publish notice in
the Federal Register. This notice is generally referred to as a System of Records Notice
{SORN), which establishes, among other things, authorized disclosures for SEVIS records. The
Form I-20 is a SEVIS record and is therefore subject tothe related SORNS, the first of which
‘was published on March 22, 2005,? and a modified SORN published on January S, 2010.
In addition to the SORNs, SEVP has also published several online resources on SEVIS,
including historical user manuals, factsheets and webinars outlining user responsibilities,
‘obligations and the importance of protecting the integrity of SEVIS data. These resources state
‘that recruiters cannot be given Forms I-20—“SEVP-certfied school sends Form I-20 directly to
student," and “A recruiter has no proper role in handling [the] Form I-20." Additionally, SEVP
aware of instances where recruiters, having obtained a student's Form I-20, subsequently
‘demanded additional payments before providing it back to the student in advance of a meeting
