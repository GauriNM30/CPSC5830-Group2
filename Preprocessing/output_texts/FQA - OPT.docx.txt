FQA – OPT
What is OPT?
OPT is temporary employment directly related to an F-1 student’s major area of study. It allows eligible students to gain practical work experience during or after their studies in the U.S.
What is pre-completion OPT?
Students have the option of doing training part-time while still a student, which is called Pre-completion OPT.  If you choose this option, you can work up to 20 hours a week while school is in session, as long as you complete a full-time course load.  During your annual vacation quarter and the break between quarters, you can work full-time (20-40 hours per week).
Pre-completion training is counted against the 12-month total as follows:
4 months part-time = 2 months full-time
Because Pre-completion OPT is deducted from the 12 months of OPT eligibility, most students prefer to save their OPT for after program completion.  However, students who may be leaving the US after completing their program or starting a higher-level degree immediately after graduation may choose this option
Students can apply for Pre-completion OPT as early as 90 days before the preferred start date
Note that Pre-completion OPT is not applying for OPT while you are still a student - it means you would engage in the practical training while you are still a student.
What’s post-completion OPT?
Post-completion OPT takes place after you have completed your academic program.  This is the most common type of OPT, and is always considered full-time with the government.  Whether you work 20 or 45 hours per week, it will count as full-time and counts towards your 12 months of available OPT.
You can apply for OPT as early as 90 days before the end of your program (your graduation date)
You can apply for OPT as late as the end of your 60-day grace period (i.e. 60 days after your I-20 end date) - though we recommend applying as early as possible to prevent delays
Does pre-completion OPT affect post-completion OPT?
Yes. Any time spent in pre-completion OPT (either part-time or full-time) will reduce the amount of post-completion OPT you can use. For example, 1 year of part-time pre-completion OPT reduces your post-completion OPT by 6 months.
When am I eligible for OPT?
Post-completion OPT takes place after you have completed your academic program.  This is the most common type of OPT, and is always considered full-time with the government.  Whether you work 20 or 45 hours per week, it will count as full-time and counts towards your 12 months of available OPT.

What must I submit if I am applying for post-completion OPT?
If you're applying for post-completion OPT, you must submit the Last Term Statement to report your last term in SEVIS. This is necessary for initiating the OPT application process.
What is the OPT Request Form and why is it important?
The OPT Request Form is a document you need to complete as part of your OPT application. It provides important details about your request, and it must be submitted before proceeding with your USCIS application.
Do I need to create a USCIS portal account for my OPT application?
Yes, you need to create a USCIS portal account to begin filling out the I-765 form and upload all required supporting documents for your OPT application.
What will I need to do during my OPT appointment with an immigration advisor?
During your OPT appointment, you will review all forms and information with your immigration advisor. The advisor will help ensure everything is in order and make necessary changes before you submit your application.
Can I submit my OPT application directly to USCIS after my appointment?
No, before submitting your application to USCIS, your immigration advisor will review it with you and help you make any necessary corrections. Once everything is finalized, you can submit the application.
What is the purpose of the OPT appointment?
The purpose of the OPT appointment is to review all your forms and information, address any questions you might have, and ensure everything is correct before submitting your application to USCIS.
How long does it take for USCIS to process my OPT application?
It typically takes about 2-3 months for USCIS to process your OPT application.
Can I stay in the U.S. while my OPT application is being processed?
Yes, you can legally remain in the U.S. while USCIS processes your OPT application, even beyond your 60-day grace period.
Is there a grace period after completing my course of study for applying for OPT?
Yes, after completing your course of study, you have a 60-day grace period to apply for OPT. However, during the OPT application process, you can stay in the U.S. beyond this grace period as long as your application is pending.
What should I do if I want to travel outside the U.S. while my OPT application is being processed?
If you intend to travel outside the U.S. during the processing of your OPT application, you should contact your immigration advisor to discuss your plans and seek advice
If you are considering applying for Optional Practical Training, you should discuss any travel plans outside of the United States with the International Student Center well in advance of the completion of your degree requirements.
Traveling out of the US while in the application process?
Travel outside of the United States while in the application process
If you have applied for OPT, but are still enrolled in classes at Seattle University, you should not encounter problems at the port of entry.
If you have completed all degree requirements and have applied for OPT, you may be able to travel outside the U.S. while your application is pending. Generally speaking, it is not advisable to travel after the first 30 days of the application process. If you choose to travel, be sure to bring any supporting documents with you, including your I-20 showing your OPT is "pending" and your receipt notice if possible. Once your application has been approved, you can re-enter the country only to “resume employment.”
Travel outside of the United States while approved for Post-Completion OPT
There is always a certain degree of risk involved when you leave the United States during your OPT time. Regulations now state re-entry during OPT is only to “resume employment”. That means that you must have the job before you leave. Your job must also be relevant to your major, and there are cases of students being denied entry back into the U.S. because their job does not match their educational level and/or major.
Please note the EAD card states “Not valid for re-entry to U.S.” This means that the EAD card alone will not allow you back into the United States. You must have other documents to ensure your return to the U.S., including but not limited to:
Valid Passport
Valid F-1 Visa
I-20 with practical training endorsement, employment info, and current travel signature on page 2
Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card
Proof of employment and continuing employment*
Students returning from 30 days or less in Canada or Mexico will need the same documents, with the exception of a valid F-1 Visa stamp. You should be able to return to the United States from Canada, Mexico, and some Caribbean islands with an expired F-1 Visa. If your F-1 Visa has expired and you wish to travel outside of North America, you will need to have your F-1 Visa renewed before returning to the United States.
It is not advised to travel during Post-OPT unless you are employed, and there is no question that your job matches your degree and educational level.
This is a general summary of travel and practical training.  If you have specific questions about travel restrictions during your OPT time, please contact the International Student Center at (206) 296-6260 or email at isc@seattleu.edu for more information.
*It is recommended that you bring adequate proof that you are employed to present upon your return to the United States. Proof may include a letter from your employer (on letterhead) that you will have a job when you return, and/or stubs from your paychecks to show that you have been working.

OPT FAQ
What kind of visa will I be on while I am doing my practical training?
Students remain on their F-1 Visa while they are doing their Optional Practical Training. There is no such thing as a “practical training Visa” or “OPT Visa.”
Do I need to have a job offer before applying for practical training?
No. Many students apply for Post-Completion Optional Practical Training before they have actually received a job offer. However, it is important to start looking for work opportunities as early as possible since it usually takes longer to find a position than students expect.
Can I divide up my practical training to do part now, and part later?
Some students want to do part-time Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT) for a few quarters while they are still taking classes full-time, then use the remainder of their training full-time after they graduate (Post-OPT). Others use full-time practical training to work for three months during their summer vacation. Dividing up practical training in this way is allowed, to a maximum of 12 months full-time, however, each period of training requires a separate application along with the $410 fee (subject to change by USCIS). You cannot divide your time for Post-Completion.
Even though I’ve completed my degree, I would like to continue to take a few classes while I am on Post-Completion Practical Training. Is that allowed?
Maybe. You may be able to take courses that are incidental, non-matriculating classes on a part-time basis. Please check with the ISC before you make any decisions on study during your Post-Completion Practical Training period.
I recently received my EAD card, but I would like to cancel it and save my practical training for later. Is this possible?
No. Once the EAD card has been issued, there is no way to cancel it.
When must I leave the United States after completing my practical training?
You have 60 days after the end date on your EAD card to leave the country, start a new academic program, or remain in the U.S. with a pending change of status. You cannot work during the 60 day grace period. You are free to travel within the United States, but you should not expect to be able to return to the U.S. with your EAD card and I-20, if you leave the country during these two months.
I applied for a year of practical training, but I never ended up working. Am I eligible to apply again?
Probably not. There is a 90-day rule that states you must report an activity (paid or unpaid) within the first 90 days of your start date for your practical training. If you do not report an activity, SEVIS will automatically complete your record. If you do find work during your OPT, you will be eligible to apply for another 12 months of work authorization only if you change your degree level, i.e. Bachelor to Master’s or Master’s to Doctorate.
Is there a deadline for the application?
If you are applying for Post-Completion, the application must be received by the USCIS Phoenix Lockbox before or within the 60 days after your I-20 end date.
What is this I hear about the 90-day cancellation?
You may have heard that your OPT is only valid for 90 days. There is a 90-day rule that states you must find an activity within the first 90 days of your approved start date. If you fail to report your employment before the 90 days, SEVIS will automatically terminate your record. The employment activity must meet the following requirements:
Be directly related to your major and appropriate for your degree level
Be a minimum of 20 hours per week
You must report the activity to the ISC so an advisor can update your SEVIS record
Can I have multiple jobs under OPT?
Yes! When you apply for OPT you do not need to have a job, so that information can always be added in later. Please remember that current regulations require that you report any activity that you are engaged in (paid or unpaid) during your period of OPT. This includes any time you change jobs, or if you quit or are fired. Failure to report this could jeopardize any period of OPT in the future. It is possible to report more than one activity in SEVIS at a given time.
Do I have to report to Seattle University during my OPT?
Yes, please email your ISC advisor or isc@seattleu.edu! You are still under F-1 student status, and your I-20 and SEVIS record will still be through Seattle University. By emailing your advisor with the below information, it will allow them to create an updated I-20 with your employment information. Therefore, it is important you update the ISC regularly during your OPT, especially if you find a new job or if there are any changes to the below information. Email your advisor with the answers to the following questions:
Explain how employment is related to your course of study:
Employer Name:
Job Title:
Number of hours per week:
Start Date:
End Date (if known):
Employer Physical Address:
Supervisor Last Name:
Supervisor First Name:
Supervisor Telephone Number OR Email Address:
Current U.S. Physical Address:
What if I want to stay in the United States and work after my year of practical training?
As of April 8, 2008 certain majors may extend their OPT. Currently, it only applies to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees. If you have found an employer who will sponsor you for an H-1B Visa, it is also possible that you may continue working the year you submit your application. If your H-1B is filed during the grace period following OPT, you may remain in the US until the decision of your application. If your H-1B is pending while on OPT, you may continue working up until the H-1B start on October 1st or until you receive notice of the H-1B denial.
