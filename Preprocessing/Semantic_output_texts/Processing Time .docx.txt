What does this processing time mean?
We generally process cases in the order we receive them. This processing time is based on how long it took us to complete 80% of adjudicated cases over the past six months. Each case is unique, and some cases may take longer than others. Processing times should be used as a reference point, not an absolute measure of how long your case will take to be completed.
Learn more about processing times.
When can I ask about my case?
Many routine factors impact how quickly a case is processed. We only allow inquiries for cases that are well outside the processing time listed above.
Learn more about the Case Inquiry Date.
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CASE PROCESSING TIMES
We display case processing times for select forms and locations to let you know how long it generally takes to process benefit requests and when you can contact us with questions about your case. We update case processing times on the website monthly with the latest available data.
This webpage provides information on how to:
Find information needed to use the processing times webpage;
Read and interpret the processing times on the webpage; and
Understand how to use the case inquiry tool.
Finding Your Case Information
You will need some specific information about your case to use the processing times webpage and case inquiry tools. Below is an example of where you can find specific information on USCIS correspondence. This information is also found on USCIS receipt notices, and some information may be found on a copy of your application, petition, or request. We also provide guidance for determining your form type (sometimes referred to as case type) and relevant form category.
If the “USCIS Office” is the National Benefits Center (NBC) and you have filed an employment-based or family-based Form I-485, a Form N-400, or a Form N-600, you should check processing times for your local field office. You can use our Field Office Locator if you need help determining your local office (scroll to the bottom of the page). If your case is transferred to another office, you should refer to the processing times for the new office.
What Does the Processing Time Mean and How Is It Calculated?
The processing time displayed on the USCIS website is the amount of time it took us to complete 80% of adjudicated cases over the last six months. Processing time is defined as the number of days (or months) that have elapsed between the date USCIS received an application, petition, or request and the date USCIS completed the application, petition, or request (that is, approved or denied it) in a given six-month period.
For example, if we received a Form N-400 on Jan. 24, 2022, and completed adjudication of the application on March 5, 2022, then the processing time for that specific application is 41 days. This calculation is done for every Form N-400 we completed in March 2022 and the five months prior to March 2022 (a six-month period).
We then review the processing times for adjudicated cases to determine how long it took for 80% of those cases to be completed over the previous six months. So, if we completed 1,000 Form N-400 applications in the previous six months, and 80% (or 800) of them were completed within 60 days (or two months), then the processing times webpage will display two months as the processing time for Form N-400 in May 2022.
Processing times generally reflect how long we have taken to complete applications, petitions, or requests. Many factors may affect how long it takes USCIS to complete an application, petition or request, such as the number of applications, petitions, or requests we receive, workload and staffing allocations, the time a benefit requestor takes responding to a request for more information, as well as policy and operational changes, among other factors.
Most forms displayed on the processing times webpage use this methodology. However, some forms use an older methodology known as “cycle time.”1 The cycle time measures how many months' worth of cases are awaiting a decision for a particular form.
For example, if an office had 500 applications for Form I-800 pending in April 2020 and the office received 200 Form I-800s in February 2020 and 300 Form I-800s in March 2020, then the cycle time for Form I-800 in April 2020 was two months (200 + 300 = 500 pending applications).
Internally, USCIS uses the cycle time methodology to gauge progress toward reducing our backlog of cases. Learn more about our internal cycle time goals for certain forms.
1. The following forms still use cycle time methodology: Form I-129, and Form I-129CW.
When and How Can I Ask a Question About the Status of My Case?
Processing times are provided as a reference point for how long we have taken to complete most cases. Because many factors impact the processing time – and to better manage our limited resources by allowing staff to focus on adjudicating cases rather than responding to inquiries – we allow inquiries for cases that are taking longer than the time USCIS took to complete 93% of adjudications. Those cases are deemed to be outside normal processing times. For forms that still use the cycle time methodology, we generally define outside normal processing times as those cases that are taking longer than 130% of the cycle time.2
You must go to the processing times webpage, where we provide a tool to help you determine whether you can request an update on your case. Using the tool, you enter your receipt date, which can be found on your receipt notice, into the text box. If your case is outside normal processing times (beyond the time to complete 93% of adjudicated cases or beyond 130% of the cycle time), you will be provided a link for submitting an inquiry. If your case is within normal processing times, you will be provided an estimated date for when you can contact us. Please check back periodically because processing times may change.
2. We use 130% of the cycle time because it is close to the time to complete 93% of adjudicated cases – though this can vary by form type and office. Because cycle times use a different methodology, they do not correspond directly to the processing times produced with our current methodology.
How Is the Case Inquiry Date Calculated?
This is how we calculate the case inquiry date:
Case Inquiry Date = [time to complete 93% of adjudicated cases] – [today’s date – receipt date]
Example:
If you checked our processing times webpage on Jan. 1, 2022, for a form you filed on Jan. 1, 2021, and the time to complete 93% of adjudicated cases was 13 months, your case inquiry date would be calculated as:
Case Inquiry Date = [13 months] – [Jan. 1, 2022 – Jan. 1, 2021]
= [13 months] – [12 months]
= one month
In this example, we estimate that you would be able to contact us in one month. The tool will provide the exact date for you. If the calculation for the case inquiry date produces a negative number, you will be able to submit a question about your case.
Frequently Asked Questions About Processing Times
General
Why is my form type or office not listed?
If your form type is not listed on the processing time webpage, you may submit an inquiry if your case has been pending more than six months. Please note that is a default timeframe for inquiring. You should not necessarily expect a decision in that timeframe. We are working to develop processing times for all forms, form categories, and offices. We will continue to add forms, form categories, and offices to the public website as they become available.
Where should I look for my processing time if my receipt lists the National Benefit Center (NBC)?
If the “USCIS Office” is the National Benefits Center (NBC) and you have filed an employment-based or family-based Form I-485, a Form N-400, or a Form N-600, you should check processing times for your local field office. You can use our Field Office Locator if you need help determining your local office (scroll to the bottom of the page).
Where can I find my receipt number?
Case Inquiries
I think my case is taking too long; when can I submit a service request?
After you obtain your processing time, a tool will appear to help you determine whether you can contact us with questions about your case. Enter your receipt date, which can be found on your receipt notice, into the text box. If your case is outside normal processing times (beyond the time to complete 93% of adjudicated cases or beyond 130% of the cycle time), you will be provided a link for submitting an inquiry. If your case is within normal processing times, you will be provided an estimated date for when you can contact us. Please check back periodically because processing times may change.
Why are the processing times increasing for the form type I submitted?
Many factors may affect how long it takes USCIS to complete an application, petition or request, such as the number of applications, petitions, or requests we receive, workload and staffing allocations, the time a benefit requestor takes responding to a request for more information, as well as policy and operational changes, among other factors.
I have been waiting longer for a decision than the time displayed for my form type and office. Why?
Many factors impact processing times, including the number of applications, petitions, or requests we receive, workload allocations, and staffing levels, among other factors. Case-specific factors may also make an individual adjudication more complex, requiring additional adjudicative time. Some of these factors can also be influenced by the benefit requestor, such as if an application, petition, or request is incomplete when we receive it, or if an applicant, petitioner, or requestor receives a request for more information or misses an appointment for biometrics submission or interview.
Methodology and Calculations of Processing Times
Do the processing times listed on the website include cases where a request for evidence (RFE) or other notice has been sent or where biometrics submission is required?
Yes, the processing times include all time from receipt to completion. This includes the amount of time it takes to submit biometrics, the time an applicant, petitioner, or requestor takes to respond to requests for more information, and rescheduling of interviews.
Are visa-regressed Forms I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, included in the calculation?
No. Visa regressed adjustment applications are not included in the processing times shown on the website. You can find additional information on visa retrogression on our website.
Are petitions that had an approval revoked included in the processing times calculations?
No. We use the first decision (that is, approval or denial) to calculate processing times.
Are premium processing cases included in the processing times calculations?
No, cases that undergo premium processing are not included in the processing times calculations.
How often is this website updated?
We make every effort to update the processing times every month. For most forms, the processing times displayed are based on data that are one month old. For forms that still use the cycle time methodology, the processing times displayed are based on data captured approximately two months prior to updating the page.
Why did USCIS switch from a range of times to showing one single time?
We received feedback that the range of times could be confusing to interpret, and we continually work to improve how we communicate processing times.
Why do some forms use the cycle time methodology to calculate processing times?
Historically, we used the cycle time methodology to present public processing times. In 2018, we implemented a revised methodology that is used for most forms. Over time, all forms will use the processing time methodology. Cycle time is now mostly used as an internal metric to measure progress we make toward reducing our backlog.
There appears to be an error on the webpage; who should I contact?
You may contact the USCIS webmaster at uscis.webmaster@uscis.dhs.gov.
I want to know what processing times were in the past; where can I find this information?
We provide historical processing times for select forms from FY 2012 to FY 2022 on the Historic Processing Times webpage. This information represents the cumulative median processing time by fiscal year (Oct. 1-Sept. 30), using the current processing time methodology. This webpage is updated on a quarterly basis.
Where can I find additional notes on how USCIS calculates the processing times for specific forms?
We place information related to specific forms on the processing time webpage in the “Notes” section and in the “Other Case Processing Time Resources” section of the processing times webpage

Ugh!! It seems like many on this thread with my receipt date got approved and cards delivered by now and nothing has changed on my case. Starting to get nervous...
EDIT: happy to have my card now but was very stressful and frustrating to have to pay for premium and then still wait like 3 weeks after that to receive my card.
