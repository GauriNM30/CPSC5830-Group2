Fee Schedule
The table below presents the fees, currently in effect, for all U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) forms.
Each application, petition, or request must be accompanied by the correct fee(s) unless you are exempt from paying the
fee(s) or are eligible for a fee waiver.  If the fee is incorrect, the application, petition, or request will be rejected.
Filing Online
You may file certain forms online as indicated in the table below.  If you file your form online
(see  the system will guide you through the process of paying your fees with a credit,
debit, or pre-paid card.  Bank account withdrawals are also available when paying online. There is often a $50 discount when
filing a form online. If online PDF intake is available for your form and you file using this tool, the $50 discount also applies.
Filing by Mail
If you are filing your application, petition, or request by mail, please visit our website for filing guidance, at
Fees for applications or petitions can be paid by
check, money order or credit card:
1) Payments by Checks or Money Orders.  You may pay fees with bank drafts, cashier's checks, certified checks, personal
checks, and money orders that are drawn on U.S. financial institutions and payable in U.S. funds.  Make the check or money
order payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security, do not use the initials “USDHS” or “DHS.”  Generally, you must
mail your check or money order together with your application or petition.  Use a separate check or money order for each
application or petition you submit.  Do not combine the filing fees for multiple applications or petitions into one check or
money order.  If paying by check or money order for a single form that requires multiple fees, pay each fee with a separate
check or money order, unless noted otherwise below or in the form instructions.
NOTE: If you send USCIS a check, we will convert it into an electronic funds transfer (EFT).  This means we will copy
your check and use the account information on it to electronically debit your account for the amount of the check.  The debit
from your account will usually take 24 hours and your bank will show it on your regular account statement.  You will not
receive your original check back.  We will destroy your original check but will keep a copy of it.  If USCIS cannot process
the EFT for technical reasons, you authorize us to process the copy in place of your original check.  If your check is returned
as unpayable, we may reject your application, petition, or request.
2) Payments by Credit Card.  You may pay your fee(s), using a credit card.  Please see Form G1450
( Authorization for Credit Card Transactions, for more information.
Filing at a USCIS Office
If you are filing your application or petition at a USCIS office; cash, a cashier's check or money order cannot be used to pay
for the filing and/or biometric services fee.  The only payment options accepted at an USCIS office are payment through
pay.gov via a credit card, debit card or with a personal check.
