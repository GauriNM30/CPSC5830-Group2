DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List
Last Updated: July 22, 2024
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) STEM Designated Degree Program List is a
complete list of fields of study that DHS considers to be science, technology, engineering or
mathematics (STEM) fields of study for purposes of the 24-month STEM optional practical training
extension described at 8 CFR 214.2(f). Under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(2), a STEM field of study is
one “included in the Department of Education’s Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomy
within the two-digit series containing engineering, biological sciences, mathematics, and physical
sciences, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involving research,
innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science,
or natural sciences (including physical, biological, and agricultural sciences).”
Accordingly, this list designates the following four primary CIP series at the 2-digit CIP code level:
Engineering (14), Biological and Biomedical Sciences (26), Mathematics and Statistics (27) and
Physical Sciences (40). Any new additions to those areas will automatically be included on this
STEM Designated Degree Program List.
This list also includes CIPs from the following 18 related CIP series at the 6-digit CIP code level:
Agricultural/Animal/Plant/Veterinary Science and Related Fields (01); Natural Resources and
Conservation (03); Architecture and Related Services (04); Communication, Journalism and Related
Programs (09); Communications Technologies/Technicians and Support Services (10); Computer
and Information Sciences and Support Services (11); Education (13); Engineering/Engineering-
Related Technologies/Technicians (15); Military Science, Leadership and Operational Art (28);
Military Technologies and Applied Sciences (29); Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies (30); Science
Technologies/Technicians (41); Psychology (42); Homeland Security, Law Enforcement,
Firefighting and Related Protective Services (43); Social Sciences (45); Transportation and
Materials Moving (49); Health Professions and Related Programs (51); and Business, Management,
Marketing and Related Support Services (52).
