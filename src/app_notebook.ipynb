Home\\n2. Students\\n3. Students and the Form I-20\\n## Students and the Form I-20\\nAll F and M students that study in the United States need a Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” Once accepted into a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school , international students will receive a Form I-20 from their designated school official (DSO) . You must also obtain a Form I-20 for any eligible dependents you plan to bring to the United States with you. However, please note that the name (i.e., Academic and Language students vs. Vocational Students) on the Form I-20 an SEVP-certified school issues you will dictate the type of student visa you may obtain from the U.S. Department of State and the status you will need to maintain in the United States. You and your DSO must both sign the Form I-20. If you are under age 18, your parents must sign the Form I-20 for you. ## Form I-20 Uses\\nThe Form I-20 is an important document that you should keep safe, as you will need it throughout the international student life cycle. ## Paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee\\nBefore you pay the I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Fee, you must receive the Form I-20 from a DSO at the school you plan to attend. You will need information from the Form I-20 to pay the fee. The I-901 SEVIS Fee is mandatory and must be paid before you enter the United States. In order to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, all prospective F and M students will need to provide their:\\n- Name, address, date of birth and email address. - Country of birth and country of citizenship. - School Code as listed on the Form I-20 “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.”\\n- SEVIS Identification Number as listed on the Form I-20. ## Applying for a nonimmigrant visa\\nThe Form I-20 lists your program start date, 30 days before which you are allowed to enter the United States. F-1 and M-1 student visas can be issued up to 365 days in advance of your course of study start date. Your type of student visa must match the type of Form I-20 you have (e.g., F-1 or M-1). You are expected to have the original Form I-20 at your visa interview. The consular officer may accept a copy of the Form I-20 in limited circumstances that warrant visa issuance prior to you receiving the original Form I-20. ## Entering the United States\\nYou are expected to have the signed Form I-20 on hand as you enter the country. Do not pack it away in your suitcase.']', Answer: 'the provided text states that the i-901 sevis fee is mandatory for f and m students but does *not* specify the amount of the fee.  to find the current fee amount, you would need to consult the official sevis website or other official dhs resources.'\u001b[0m\n"
