## Form Details
04/01/24 . You can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.
Dates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.
If you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are missing or are from a different form edition, we may reject your form.
If you need help downloading and printing forms, read our instructions .
For a complete list of addresses, visit our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-751 page.
If USCIS granted you conditional permanent resident status through marriage to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, use Form I-751 to file for the removal of those conditions.
If you are filing Form I-751 jointly with your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse:
- You must file your Form I-751 during the 90-day period immediately before your conditional residence expires.
- Visit ourWhen to File Your Petition to Remove Conditions, page to determine the first day of your 90-day filing window. If you file your petition before that date, it may be rejected.
If you were not included in your parent’s petition and are filing a separate joint petition with your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident stepparent:
- You may file your I-751 petition at any time before your conditional permanent resident status expires.
If you are not filing your I-751 petition jointly, and are requesting a waiver of the joint filing requirement for one of the following reasons:
- Termination of your status and removal from the United States would result in extreme hardship;
- You or your parent entered into the marriage in good faith, but your spouse or stepparent subsequently died;
- You entered into your marriage in good faith, but the marriage ended by annulment or divorce;
- You entered into your marriage in good faith, but during the marriage you or your child were battered or subjected to extreme cruelty committed by your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse; or
- Your parent entered into the marriage in good faith, but during the marriage you were battered or subject to extreme cruelty by your parent or your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident stepparent.
You may file your Form I-751 individually, or with a request to waive the joint filing requirement depending on the circumstance, at any time before your conditional permanent resident status expires.
Refer to the form instructions for more specific guidance related to waivers or filing your Form I-751 petition and to our Removing Conditions on Permanent Residence Based on Marriage , page.
You can find the filing fee for Form I-751 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.
You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.
Please do not submit this checklist with your Form I-751. The checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form, but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. We recommend that you review these requirements before completing and submitting your form. Do not send original documents unless specifically requested in the form instructions or applicable regulations.
If you submit any documents (copies or original documents, if requested) in a foreign language, you must include a full English translation along with a certification from the translator verifying that the translation is complete and accurate, and that they are competent to translate from the foreign language into English.
