Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) Petitions To obtain a Green Card as an Afghan who was employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government, whether you live inside or outside the United States, you must first seek special immigrant classification by filing either Form I-360 with USCIS or by filing Form DS-157, Petition for Special Immigrant Classification for Afghan SIV Applicants, with the U.S. Department of State (DOS).
Afghan citizens or nationals who already started the SIV application process and received DOS Chief of Mission (COM) approval on or before July 20, 2022, must still file Form I-360 with USCIS on their own behalf. For individuals in the United States with COM requests pending on July 20, 2022, please reference the chart below.
Note: COM = Department of State Chief of Mission (COM) approval
Further guidance related to obtaining a Green Card as an Afghan who was employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government can be found in the Form I-360 instructions and by visiting the Green Card for an Afghan Who Was Employed by or on Behalf of the U.S. Government webpage.
Please note that Afghans who start the SIV application process on or after July 20, 2022, no longer need to file Form I-360. Instead, they would seek classification as a special immigrant with the DOS. For more information on that process, see Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans - Who Were Employed by/on Behalf of the U.S. Government on the DOS web site.
Special Immigrant Juvenile If you are filing Form I-360 as a Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ), you must file your petition for SIJ classification before your 21st birthday. See 8 CFR 204.11(b). Sometimes, circumstances such as mailing delays or state court delays in obtaining a required juvenile court order might prevent you from timely filing your petition before your 21st birthday. To help you file Form I-360 before your 21st birthday, we will allow you to file the Form I-360 in person at a USCIS field office within 2 weeks before you turn 21.
You (or your attorney or accredited representative) may contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 to request an SIJ expedite appointment with a USCIS field office to file the Form I-360 in person within the 2 weeks before your 21st birthday. At the appointment, the field office will accept the Form I-360 and date-stamp the first page. The field office will give you a photocopy of the first page of the Form I-360 and will send the form and any supporting documents to the USCIS lockbox for receipting.
Further guidance can be found in the Form I-360 instructions and by visiting the Special Immigrant Juveniles webpage.
Special Immigrant Religious Worker If you are filing Form I-360 for a special immigrant religious worker, you must submit the employer attestation in Form I-360. If applicable, you are also required to submit the religious denomination certification in Form I-360. Further eligibility requirements can be found in the Form I-360 instructions and by visiting the Special Immigrant Religious Workers webpage.
VAWA Self-Petitioning Spouses, Children, and Parents Under the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), you may be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident if you are the victim of battery or extreme cruelty committed by:
- A U.S. citizen spouse or former spouse;
- A U.S. citizen parent;
- A U.S. citizen son or daughter;
- A lawful permanent resident (LPR) spouse or former spouse; or
- An LPR parent.
You may self-petition under VAWA by filing Form I-360 without your abusive family member’s knowledge or consent. A person who files a VAWA self-petition is generally known as a VAWA self-petitioner. If your self-petition is approved and you meet other eligibility requirements, you may be eligible to apply to become a lawful permanent resident. For more information, see the Questions and Answers: Abused Spouses, Children and Parents Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) , and Green Card for VAWA Self-Petitioner webpages.
Widow(er)s of Deceased U.S. Citizens At one time, section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act said a citizen’s surviving spouse could file an immigrant visa petition if the citizen and surviving spouse had been married at least 2 years. On Oct. 28, 2009, section 568(c) of Pub. L. 111-83 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act so that you may be eligible to immigrate, even if you and your deceased spouse were married for less than two years when your spouse died. However, you must still file your Form I-360 no later than 2 years after your spouse’s death .
Your eligibility for classification as the widow(er) of a U.S. citizen based on a Form I-360 that you file after your citizen spouse died, ends if you remarry before you immigrate or adjust status.
If your deceased citizen spouse filed a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative , before they died, you do not need to file a Form I-360 because we automatically converted your spouse’s Form I-130 to a Form I-360. If your immigrant visa petition was originally filed as a Form I-130, your remarriage does not necessarily mean you cannot immigrate. Section 204(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows us to approve the petition as a Form I-130, even if you have remarried.
Further guidance can be found in the Form I-360 instructions and on the Widow(er) webpage.
Other classifications not listed above may be eligible to use Form I-360. Please refer to the form instructions for more information regarding eligibility and when to file.
You can find the filing fee for Form I-360 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.
You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.
If you are required to pay a fee for your petition or are unable to submit your petition electronically, you may still follow the form instructions and submit the Form I-360 by mail.
