## What is it?
The SEVIS Data Mapping Tool is an interactive map that illustrates trends and information on international students studying in the United States using data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
SEVIS is the web-based tool that the Department of Homeland Security uses to maintain information on F and M students in the United States. The map is updated with information from SEVIS every month.
You can start exploring the data from either a Continent or United States perspective. Start with the Continent map to analyze trends from a continent, region or country. Start with the United States map to analyze trends in a specific U.S. state. Both maps include information about:
- Where international students come from.
- Who international students are (male/female ratios).
- What level of education international students enroll in.
Each map also includes information about students studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Please note, the tool only aggregates this information at the continent level.
Find more international student trends and information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program sections on HSI.gov's SEVIS by the Numbers page .
When you click on one of the images below, an interactive map will appear.
