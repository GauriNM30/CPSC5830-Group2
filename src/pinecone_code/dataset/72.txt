## I-129,Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker
Alert: On Jan. 17, 2025, we published a revised edition of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, (edition date: 01/17/25) reflecting combined changes associated with the recently announced H-1B modernization final rule and the H-2 modernization final rule . There is no grace period for the revised edition of Form I-129 because this revised edition is necessary for USCIS to apply the final rules.
Effective Jan. 17, 2025, we will reject Form I-129 petitions received using the 04/01/24 edition of the form. If you file Form I-129 on paper by mail, please note that:
- We will accept the 04/01/24 edition of Form I-129 if it is receivedbeforeJan. 17, 2025;
We will accept the 04/01/24 edition of Form I-129 if it is received before Jan. 17, 2025;

We will only accept the 01/17/25 edition of Form I-129 if it is received on or after Jan. 17, 2025.
ALERT: At intake, we determine whether the payment you submitted matches the correct fees due. If you do not submit the correct fee, we must reject your form, even if you have submitted an overpayment.
The required fees for Form I-129, Form I-129CW, and Form I-140 depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer. See our Web Alert for more information: USCIS Reminds Certain Employment-Based Petitioners to Submit the Correct Required Fees
You can find additional filing fee information by visiting our Filing Fees page, our Form G-1055, Fee Schedule , and our Frequently Asked Questions on the USCIS Fee Rule page.
ALERT: If you are an H-1B or an L-1 nonimmigrant and your dependent spouse or child is applying for an extension of their existing H-4 or L-2 status, or a change of status to H-4 or L-2, we will adjudicate your dependent spouse or child’s application together with your Form I-129 if the Form I-539 is packaged together with and properly filed at the same time and in the same location as your Form I-129. This means that an officer will review the H-4 or L-2 derivative’s Form I-539 after reviewing the principal’s Form I-129 and will take appropriate adjudicative action (that is, issue an approval, denial, RFE, NOID or refer for an investigation) after that adjudicative review. This includes a Form I-765 filed by your dependent spouse for an employment authorization document based on H-4 or L-2 status, as applicable. If your dependent’s associated applications are not properly submitted together with your Form I-129, we will adjudicate them separately.
Petitioners use this form to file on behalf of a nonimmigrant worker to come to the United States temporarily to perform services or labor, or to receive training, as an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-1S, P-2, P-2S, P-3, P-3S, Q-1 or R-1 nonimmigrant worker. Petitioners may also use this form to request an extension of stay in or change of status to E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B1 or TN, or one of the above classifications for an alien.

All petitioners requesting an extension of stay for a beneficiary who entered the United States based on an approved blanket L petition must file the following:
- Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;
- Form I-129S, Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition; and
- A copy of their previously approved Form I-129S.
We may reject any Form I-129 for an L-1 blanket extension of stay request that does not also include Form I-129S.
Change of Status Requests for Beneficiaries Who are in the United States Based on an Approved Blanket L Petition
All petitioners requesting a change of status to L-1 based on an approved blanket L petition for a beneficiary who is currently in the United States must file the following:
- Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; and
- Form I-129S, Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition.
We may reject any Form I-129 for an L-1 blanket change of status request that does not also include Form I-129S.
Evidence of Petition Approval Needed When Traveling
Along with a valid passport and visa (if applicable), the noncitizen beneficiary should carry the following documents when traveling to the United States:
- Form I-797, Notice of Action, stating we approved the petition; or
- A copy of the approved Form I-129S (if applicable).
The beneficiary should present this documentation to U.S. Customs and Border Protection when seeking entry or re-entry into the United States in the approved Form I-129 employment classification.
Evidence of a petition approval is not a visa, and the beneficiary must possess the appropriate nonimmigrant visa (if one is required) before applying for admission into the United States.
Form I-94 Validity
When a beneficiary with an approved Form I-129 is admitted to the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection grants the beneficiary a period of stay documented on Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, or as noted in the passport or travel document.
If the expiration date on Form I-94 ends before the end of the Form I-129's validity period (as shown on Form I-797, Notice of Action) one of the following must occur before the expiration date on Form I-94 or as noted in the passport or travel document:
- A petitioner must file a request for an extension of stay on behalf of the beneficiary using Form I-129;
- The beneficiary must file an application for some other immigration benefit that would allow them to remain in the United States; or
- The beneficiary must depart the United States.
If the nonimmigrant worker’s stay is limited as described above, any dependent family members who accompanied or followed to join the beneficiary must also:
- Timely request an extension of stay using Form I-539;
- Timely apply for some other immigration benefit that would allow the family member to remain in the United States; or
- Depart the United States before the expiration date on the family member’s Form I-94 or the date noted in the family member’s passport or travel document.

Part 6 is not required for petitions for all other classifications, including but not limited to blanket L petitions (LZ). See Part 6 of Form I-129: Frequently Asked Questions for more information.
