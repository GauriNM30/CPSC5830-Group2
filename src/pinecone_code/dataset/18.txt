## Open Doors Report: A Record High Number of International Students
On Nov. 18, 2024, the Institute of International Education (IIE) released its annual Open Doors Report . The report, which is released each year as part of International Education Week, includes detailed information and data about post-secondary student flows into and out of the United States during the previous academic year.
The Open Doors report for the 2023-2024 academic year showed a record high 1.1 million students from around the world studied in the United States, a 7 percent increase from 2022-2023. International students contributed over $50 billion to the U.S. economy, supporting academic campuses and their surrounding communities.
India became the top country of origin for the first time since 2009, with a 35 percent increase in Indian students. China, while seeing a 4 percent decline, remains the second-largest source of international students, especially for undergraduates.
Eight of the top 25 countries, including Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, and Nepal, saw record-high numbers of students studying in the United States. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a notable 13 percent increase.
Other significant trends from the 2024 Open Doors report include:
- International graduate student enrollments increased by 8 percent, while undergraduate enrollment slightly declined by 1 percent.
- 56 percent of international students were enrolled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Computer Science, Engineering and Data Analytics remain the most popular.
- California, New York and Texas host the largest international student populations, significantly boosting local economies.
IIEâ€™s Open Doors Report is based on a survey of approximately 3,000 accredited , Student and Exchange Visitor Program-certified post-secondary institutions in the United States.
