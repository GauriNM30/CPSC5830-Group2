Alert: Before sending your package to USCIS, make sure that all the forms you have completed are the current acceptable edition. The current acceptable edition can be found under the Edition Date section listed on each form’s webpage.
You can also find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions. For each form that you are submitting, make sure that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are from a different form edition, we may reject your form. Watch USCIS Forms: Download the most recent version! to see how to ensure your form is acceptable.
For additional guidance on filing paper-based forms at the Lockbox and how to avoid or correct common errors before you file, please visit the Five Steps to File at the USCIS Lockbox webpage.
ALERT: On Sept. 10, 2024, we began automatically extending the validity of permanent resident cards (also known as Green Cards) to 36 months from the expiration date on the face of the current Green Card for lawful permanent residents (LPR) who file Form I-90 to renew an expiring or expired Green Card.. We are in the process of sending out amended receipt notices for individuals with a pending Form I-90.
On Sept. 10, 2024, we began automatically extending the validity of permanent resident cards (also known as Green Cards) to 36 months from the expiration date on the face of the current Green Card for lawful permanent residents (LPR) who file Form I-90 to renew an expiring or expired Green Card. We are in the process of sending out amended receipt notices for individuals with a pending Form I-90. You can present a receipt notice with an expired Green Card as evidence of LPR. Your amended receipt notice with your expired Green Card provides proof of employment and travel authorization for 36 months from the expiration date on the front of your expired Green Card.
It will take some time to send out all the amended receipt notices. If you are in urgent need of evidence of status and employment eligibility while you wait for your amended receipt notice or your replacement Green Card, or if you need another in-person service, you may call the USCIS Contact Center to request an appointment. We encourage you to wait for your amended receipt notice instead of scheduling an appointment that you may not need.

DO NOT submit this form if you are a conditional resident seeking to remove conditions on your Green Card .
If you are a conditional resident, you must submit one of the following:
- Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence, to remove conditions on a Green Card obtained through marriage; or
- Form I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status, to remove conditions on a Green Card obtained through financial investment in a U.S. business.
Beginning in January 2021, if you are applying to renew your Green Card, your Form I-90 receipt notice (also known as Form I-797) will say the following and can be used with your expired Green Card as evidence of your lawful permanent resident status:
This notice provides evidence of your lawful permanent resident status for 12 months from the expiration date on your Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card (also known as a Green Card). You remain authorized to work and travel. This notice, presented with your expired Permanent Resident Card, is evidence of your status and work authorization.
If you do not have your Green Card or your card expired more than 12 months ago, you will need evidence of your lawful permanent resident status while waiting to receive a new Green Card, and we may issue you an Alien Documentation, Identification & Telecommunications (ADIT) stamp after you file this form. Additionally, if you applied for naturalization at least six months before your Green Card expired, you may be able to receive an ADIT stamp valid for up to 12 months instead of filing a Form I-90. If you need assistance, contact the USCIS Contact Center .
If we already accepted your application to renew your Green Card and you have not been issued a biometrics appointment notice, we will mail you a new receipt notice to use with your expired Green Card as temporary evidence of your lawful permanent resident status.
If you do not receive this receipt notice or your notice is lost or damaged and you have a USCIS online account , you can print a copy of the notice for your records. If you need to demonstrate proof of status or have a need to travel, please reach out to our USCIS Contact Center .
As a lawful permanent resident, you must have a valid, unexpired Green Card or equivalent documentation with you at all times. Applying for naturalization does not change this requirement.

You will receive a USCIS Account Acceptance Notice with instructions on how to access your USCIS online account.

You should file Form I-90 to renew your Permanent Resident Card if you were issued a card valid for 10 years that has either expired or will expire within the next 6 months.
Also, if you became a permanent resident before you turned 14 years old, you must replace your card when you become 14 years old.
If your permanent resident card does not have an expiration date on the front, we recommend you File Form I-90 to renew it. Most old versions are no longer valid.
If you were issued a permanent resident card that is valid for only 2 years, you are a conditional resident and you cannot file Form I-90 to renew your card. Instead, you are required to file a petition to remove those conditions within 90 days before your permanent resident card expires.
- If your conditional status was based on a marriage, fileForm I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence.
- If your conditional status was based on being an investor or entrepreneur, fileForm I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status.
If you do not file the petition to remove the conditions before your card expires, you may lose your permanent resident status.
You can find the filing fee for Form I-90 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.

If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package.

- It was returned to us as undeliverable; and
