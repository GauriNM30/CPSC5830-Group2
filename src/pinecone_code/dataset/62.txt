## I-765,Application for Employment Authorization
ALERT : On Dec. 13, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule that permanently increases the automatic extension period for employment authorization and Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) available to certain EAD renewal applicants from up to 180 days to up to 540 days. The final rule will continue to help prevent eligible renewal EAD applicants from experiencing a lapse in employment authorization and/or the validity of their EAD due to lengthy processing times.
The final rule became effective on Jan.13, 2025 , and applies to certain timely filed renewal EAD applications pending on, or filed on or after May 4, 2022.
ALERT : On April 1, 2024, new filing fees went into effect. Since then, we have seen a significant increase in Forms I-765 filed without the correct fee. Please confirm that you have included the correct fee before submitting your Form I-765. Visit our G-1055, Fee Schedule , webpage for a full list of Form I-765 filing fees. We also encourage you to visit our Frequently Asked Questions on the USCIS Fee Rule page. Each application, petition, or request must be accompanied by the correct fee(s) unless you are exempt from paying the fee(s) or are eligible for a fee waiver. Your application, petition, or request will be rejected if the fee is incorrect.
ALERT – NEW TEMPORARY FINAL RULE INCREASES AUTOMATIC EXTENSION PERIOD FOR CERTAIN EAD RENEWAL APPLICANTS: On April 4, 2024, USCIS announced a temporary final rule (TFR) that increased the automatic extension period for employment authorization and EADs of certain EAD renewal applicants from up to 180 days to up to 540 days.
The new temporary final rule is effective on April 8, 2024. This temporary final rule will apply to EAD renewal applicants eligible to receive an automatic extension who timely and properly filed their Form I-765 applications on or after Oct. 27, 2023, if the application is still pending on April 8, 2024. The temporary final rule will also apply to EAD renewal applicants eligible to receive an automatic extension who timely and properly file their Form I-765 application on or after April 8, 2024, and on or before Sept. 30, 2025 (540 days after publication of this temporary final rule in the Federal Register .
2022 TFR PREVIOUSLY INCREASED AUTOMATIC EXTENSION PERIOD
On May 4, 2022, DHS published a temporary final rule (TFR) titled “ Temporary Increase of the Automatic Extension Period of Employment Authorization and Documentation for Certain Renewal Applicants ” (2022 TFR) in the Federal Register. The rule temporarily amended DHS regulations at 8 CFR 274a.13(d) by adding a new paragraph 8 CFR 274a.13(d)(5), which lengthened the automatic extension period provided in that section from up to 180 days to up to 540 days for those categories described in the TFR, upon timely and properly filing of an EAD renewal application. That increase was available to eligible renewal applicants whose EAD applications were pending as of May 4, 2022, including those applicants whose employment authorization had already lapsed following the initial 180-day extension period, and to eligible applicants who filed an EAD renewal application during the 540-day period beginning on or after May 4, 2022, and ending Oct. 26, 2023. Automatic extensions of employment authorization and EAD validity for EAD renewal filings made on or after Oct. 27, 2023, reverted to the original up to 180-day period for those eligible applicants who timely and properly file Form I-765 renewal applications. That reversion was not retroactive; all previous up to 540-day automatic extensions for EAD renewal applications filed before Oct. 27, 2023, remain in place. For individuals who received an increased automatic extension under the first temporary final rule, the automatic extension generally will end when their application is approved or denied, or the end of the up to 540-day period, whichever comes earlier.
ALERT: Please remember that photos submitted to USCIS must be unmounted and unretouched. Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced. The submission of any mounted or retouched images will delay the processing of your application and may prompt USCIS to require that you appear at an Applicant Support Center to verify your identity.
ALERT: We have updated the filing address to request a replacement Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that contains a mistake due to USCIS error. Please follow the instructions listed on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 webpage for card replacements due to USCIS error.
ALERT– PAROLEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERS: You are likely eligible to apply for an employment authorization document (EAD) to legally work in the United States if:
- You were recently paroled into the United States and that parole remains valid; or
- You have applied for asylum and that application has been pending for at least 150 days.
If you have not already started the EAD application process, you can begin here by creating a USCIS account online and filing Form-I-765 . USCIS will mail your work permit to the address you provided in your application if your application is approved. If necessary, you can file a paper application for Form I-765 instead.
If you have not already started the EAD application process, you can begin here by creating a USCIS account online and filing Form-I-765 . We will mail your work permit to the address you provided in your application if your application is approved. If necessary, you can file a paper application for Form I-765 instead.
Certain aliens who are in the United States may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Other aliens whose immigration status authorizes them to work in the United States without restrictions may also use Form I-765 to apply for an EAD that shows such authorization.
After we approve a Form I-765, your EAD card should be produced within 2 weeks. We will mail your EAD card via U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Priority Mail.
Please ensure you have the correct mailing address on file with USCIS. If your mailing address changes after you file your application, you must update your address with USCIS and USPS as soon as possible. If you don’t update your address promptly, your case could be delayed, your document(s) could get lost, and you may need to reapply and pay the fee again.
The timeframe in which you will receive your EAD card may vary, depending on USPS delivery times. Please allow a total of 30 days from approval before inquiring with USCIS. We encourage you to use Case Status Online to find your USPS tracking number for EAD card delivery. If you have not received your EAD card within this time frame, please visit e-Request - Self Service Tools (uscis.gov) for instructions on how to submit an inquiry.

If you are a replacing a card that has incorrect information, please see the Special Instructions provided below.
If you wish to renew an existing employment authorization card (EAD), you should file Form I-765 within 6 months of the expiration date on your current EAD. We recommend you do not file a request to renew your EAD more than 180 days before the expiration of your EAD. We generally do not backdate or postdate the renewal EAD in relation to your current EAD’s validity period.
Please refer to the Form I-765 instructions for information on other specific categories.
To renew your Employment Authorization Document, file Form I-765 at least 90 days before the expiration.
You must wait 150 days before you can apply for an EAD, and an additional 30 days before we can issue you an EAD, for a total of 180 days starting from when you filed your I-589 asylum application. The number of days a completed asylum application is considered pending does not include any delays requested or caused by you while your application is pending with the USCIS asylum office or with an EOIR Immigration Judge. (See 8 CFR 208.7) This period during which your asylum application is pending before we may grant you an EAD is called the “180-day Asylum EAD Clock.” We may reject your Form I-765 if you file it before the 150-day waiting period has elapsed. Further details can be found in the Form I-765 Instructions.
If you have received a Recommended Approval notice from the USCIS asylum office recommending a grant of asylum, you do not need to wait 150 days and may apply for an EAD immediately upon receipt of this notice. Provide a copy of your notice as evidence of your recommended approval with your Form I-765.
You can find the filing fee for Form I-765 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.
You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee.
If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.
There is no filing fee for the initial, renewal, or replacement Form I-765 filed by current or former service members who were paroled into the United States under the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative (IMMVI) .
Please write "IMMVI" at the top of Form I-765 to obtain the fee exemption and submit documentation that supports current or former military service such as the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service (NGB Form 22), or other official service or discharge document.

T Applicants : If you are a principal T nonimmigrant applicant, you are authorized to work based on your status. After we approve the underlying application for T nonimmigrant status, we will issue you an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). This means you will not need to file Form I-765.
If you are a derivative family member residing inside the United States, you are also authorized to work based on your status. After we approve the underlying application for derivative T nonimmigrant status, we will not issue you an EAD. You will need to file Form I-765.
If you live in the United States, you may receive deferred action and employment authorization if you have a pending bona fide application and meet certain discretionary standards. Generally, you will only be eligible for these benefits associated with a bona fide determination if you file a bona fide application for T nonimmigrant status on or after Aug. 28, 2024. We strongly encourage you to file Form I-765 under category (c)(40) at the same time you file your application for T nonimmigrant status, to timely receive deferred action and employment authorization. If you do not file Form I-765 concurrently, we will issue a notice instructing you how to file a Form I-765 for employment authorization associated with a bona fide determination.
U Petitioners: If you are a principal U nonimmigrant petitioner, you are authorized to work based on your status. After we approve the underlying petition for U nonimmigrant status, we will issue you an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). This means you will not need to file Form I-765.
If you are a derivative family member residing inside the United States, you are also authorized to work based on your status. After we approve the underlying petition for derivative U nonimmigrant status, we will not issue you an EAD. This means you will need to file Form I-765.
We can only issue EADs for principals and derivatives after we approve the underlying U nonimmigrant status petition, regardless of when you file Form I-765.
If you live in the United States, you may receive employment authorization and deferred action if you have a pending bona fide petition and meet certain discretionary standards. We will issue a notice if you need to file a Form I-765 for employment authorization associated with a bona fide determination.
If the statutory cap is reached in a fiscal year and we use the waiting list process described at 8 CFR 214.14(d)(2), petitioners for U nonimmigrant status and derivatives in the United States can apply for employment authorization using Form I-765 based on deferred action. We can only approve an application for employment authorization based on deferred action after DHS has issued deferred action in your case, regardless of when you file Form I-765.
