## I-589,Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal
ALERT: If you are currently in EOIR proceedings please refer to revised pre-order instructions on biometrics collection for Form I-589 applicants. All I-589 applicants in EOIR proceedings must refer to the 12/16/2024 revised pre-order instructions that may be found here: Instructions for Submitting Certain Applications in Immigration Court and For Providing Biometric and Biographic Information to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .These instructions provide that I-589 applicants will no longer need to mail USCIS information to complete their biometrics collection.
Alert: If you already have a Form I-589 pending with USCIS as a principal applicant, please do not submit another Form I-589 as a principal applicant. Effective Oct. 28, 2024, we will reject any Form I-589 filed on paper at the Lockbox if the principal applicant already has a pending Form I-589 as a principal applicant. We are making this change to improve efficiency. This change also is consistent with our current practice to reject duplicate Forms I-589 filed online by the same principal applicant. If you need to update a Form I-589 that you already filed as a principal applicant, you may contact the asylum office where your Form I-589 is pending. If you are already listed as a derivative applicant on a pending Form I-589, and you want to submit a simultaneous filing as a principal applicant, see the “Special Instructions” section below for more information.
We understand that we previously allowed multiple paper filings, but to increase efficiency we will no longer accept Form I-589 filed on paper at the Lockbox if the principal applicant already has a pending Form I-589 as a principal applicant. Allowing applicants to update prior filings at the appropriate asylum office is more efficient.
ALERT : Applying for Asylum with USCIS for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members
On Dec. 11, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California approved a class action settlement agreement in Ms. L. v. ICE , 18-cv-00428 (S.D. Cal.) (“Settlement Agreement”). This lawsuit relates to families who were apprehended together by the U.S. government at the U.S.-Mexico border between Jan. 20, 2017 and Jan. 20, 2021, but were then separated and kept apart. The Settlement Agreement provides benefits for Ms. L. Settlement Class members applying for asylum. For more information, please visit our Applying for Asylum with USCIS for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members page.
ALERT: Important Information About Where to File Form I-589
Effective May 9, 2024, we will reject affirmative asylum applications improperly filed at service centers instead of at the lockbox with jurisdiction over your place of residence. We announced this change in filing location on May 31, 2023, and finalized the associated Form I-589 revision in the Federal Register, 88 FR 60703 (Sept. 5, 2023). We expect this change to help streamline asylum processing and improve adjudication efficiency by digitizing paper filings.
Certain categories of affirmative asylum applicants must continue to mail their applications directly to the Asylum Vetting Center. Unaccompanied children (UCs) in immigration court proceedings must mail their applications to the lockbox. Online filing is also available to affirmative asylum applicants who are not in immigration court proceedings and who do not have to submit their application to the Asylum Vetting Center. See the “Where to File” and “Special instructions” sections below for more information and to learn where to file your application. You can also use our Filing Instructions Tool to determine where to file your Form I-589.
ALERT: Filing Tips for Affirmative Asylum Applications
USCIS is seeing an increase in the submission of paper-filed affirmative asylum applications that we must reject because they are incomplete or improperly filed. To avoid rejections and processing delays when filing Form I-589 with USCIS, it is important to properly submit a complete and signed application to the correct location.
- Carefully review the Form I-589 Instructions and ‘Form Filing Tips’ section below to ensure your asylum application is complete and on the correct 03/01/2023 edition of the form.
- File your Form I-589 in the correct location. See the ‘Where to File’ section below for more information. You can also use ourFiling Instructions Toolto determine where to file your Form I-589.
ALERT: Expeditious Asylum Adjudication for Certain Afghans
On Sept. 30, 2021, the president signed the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act . At the direction of Congress, citizens and nationals of Afghanistan or persons with no nationality who last habitually resided in Afghanistan, and who meet eligibility criteria, are entitled to certain benefits, including rapid adjudication of asylum applications.
Please follow the specific instructions on our Information for Afghans page.
Use this form to apply for asylum in the United States and for withholding of removal (formerly called “withholding of deportation”). You may file for asylum if you are physically present in the United States and you are not a U.S. citizen.
Obtain asylum in the United States by:
- Filing foraffirmative asylumif you are not in proceedings before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR); or
- Filing for asylum defensively if you are in proceedings in front of an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) at EOIR. See “Where to File” section below for information about how to determine if you are in proceedings before EOIR.
If you fail to file Form I-589 within 1 year of your arrival in the United States, you may not be eligible to apply for asylum under section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).
Form I-589 (Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal) and Instructions are available for reading in 12 languages, including: Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Dari, French, Haitian Creole, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese. However, please note that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) only accepts completed forms in English.

Who May File with USCIS
You may file your affirmative Form I-589 with USCIS if you are not a U.S. citizen, are physically present in the United States, and:
- You have never been issued an A-Number; or
- You have been issued an A-Number, but you are not currently in Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) proceedings (see below for more information about how to check whether you are in EOIR proceedings); or
- You are in removal proceedings and are currently, or were previously determined to be, an "unaccompanied alien child" (UAC).
You may not file your Form I-589 with USCIS if you are currently in proceedings with EOIR, unless you are currently, or were previously determined to be, a UAC as defined in 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2). You must file your Form I-589 with EOIR if you are in proceedings before an immigration judge or before the Board of Immigration Appeals and you are not and were never determined to be a UAC.
These steps will help you determine whether you are in EOIR proceedings:
1. Have you been issued an "Alien Number" (A-Number)? The A-Number begins with the letter “A” and is followed by 8 or 9 digits (for example, A123456789). This number is printed on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and EOIR correspondence and documents, including USCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) documents.
2. If you have been issued an A-Number, check whether you are in EOIR proceedings by:Calling the EOIR Automated Case Information Hotline toll-free in the United States at 800-898-7180 (TDD 800-828-1120) or 304-625-2050 (local toll call); orChecking theEOIR Automated Case Informationonline system.
- Calling the EOIR Automated Case Information Hotline toll-free in the United States at 800-898-7180 (TDD 800-828-1120) or 304-625-2050 (local toll call); or
- Checking theEOIR Automated Case Informationonline system.
3. If the EOIR hotline or online system has information regarding your name and next hearing date, then your Form I-862, Notice to Appear (NTA), has been filed and docketed with EOIR and you are in EOIR proceedings. If you want to apply for asylum, you must file your Form I-589 with EOIR. To locate where to file your Form I-589 with EOIR:Use the EOIR hotline or online system to locate an address for the immigration court where you must file your Form I-589; orFind immigration court information on theDepartment of Justice’swebsite.
- Use the EOIR hotline or online system to locate an address for the immigration court where you must file your Form I-589; or
- Find immigration court information on theDepartment of Justice’swebsite.
4. If you are currently in EOIR proceedings and you were asked to provide your biometric and biographical information to USCIS for your Form I-589 filed with EOIR, please refer to theInstructions for Submitting Certain Applications in Immigration Court and for Providing Biometric and Biographic Information to U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Servicesand the Defensive Asylum Security and Background Checks and Biometrics Scheduling FAQs section of theImmigration Benefits in EOIR Proceedingspage about how to submit this information.
Important: If you file your Form I-589 anywhere other than the immigration court identified by the EOIR hotline or online system, EOIR will reject your Form I-589 and send you a notice that specifies the address where you should file your Form I-589. If you do not follow these instructions and any additional instructions from DHS or EOIR, your Form I-589 may be rejected or closed or it may take longer to process your Form I-589.
For more information about applying for asylum while in EOIR proceedings, see the section on Defensive Asylum Processing with EOIR on the Obtaining Asylum in the United States webpage.

Applications that Must be Filed with the Asylum Vetting Center
Below are instructions for filing Form I-589 if you cannot file at the locations listed in the “Where to File” section above because your Form I-589 requires special handling.
When you file your Form I-589, you must include a letter explaining why you are filing with the Asylum Vetting Center and identifying which category below applies to your Form I-589. If your Form I-589 does not match any of the categories listed below, we will reject it, with instructions to file with the appropriate lockbox.
The following Forms I-589 must be filed with the Asylum Vetting Center:
- Loss of Derivative Status After Asylum Approval but Before Adjustment of Status (Nunc Pro Tunc):If you are currently a derivative asylee, but you are unable to adjust status to lawful permanent resident due to a loss of derivative relationship, then you may submit a new Form I-589 and request a grant of asylum nunc pro tunc. In your letter, please provide information about your previous Form I-589 and explain that you are now filing independently as a principal applicant.
- Loss of Derivative Status After Initial Filing but Before Final Decision:If you withdrew from a principal’s Form I-589 as a dependent, or if you lost derivative status by marriage, divorce, or death of the principal applicant, then you may submit Form I-589 as a principal applicant. In your letter, please provide information about your previous Form I-589 and explain that you are now filing independently as a principal applicant.
- Simultaneous Filing as a Principal Applicant and a Derivative Applicant:If you are already listed as a derivative applicant on another pending Form I-589, you may file Form I-589 as a principal applicant. Also, you and your spouse may file separate Forms I-589 at the same time as principal applicants and list each other as derivative applicants. In your letter, please provide information about any previous Form I-589 and explain that you are now filing independently as a principal applicant.
- Previously Issued a Final Action by USCIS on a Form I-589:If you previously filed Form I-589 with USCIS, you may be eligible to file a new Form I-589 with USCIS if you have not been placed into immigration court proceedings after USCIS denied or dismissed your Form I-589, including if we dismissed it after you withdrew your Form I-589.
