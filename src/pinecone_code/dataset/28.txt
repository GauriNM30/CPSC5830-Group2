## Family of Refugees and Asylees
If you entered the United States as a refugee within the past 2 years or were granted asylee status within the past 2 years, you may petition for certain family members to obtain derivative refugee or asylee status. If you have not yet been granted or applied for refugee or asylee status, please see the Refugees and Asylum page.
## You May Petition for the Following Family Members:
- Spouse
- Child (unmarried and under 21 when you first applied for asylum or refugee status)
- As the petitioner, you must be a principal refugee or asylee. This means that you were granted refugee or asylee status directly and did not obtain it through a relative.
- You entered the United States as a refugee within the past 2 years or were granted asylum within the past 2 years.
- You remain in refugee or asylee status or have become a permanent resident (received a Green Card). If you have already become a U.S. citizen through naturalization, you cannot petition to obtain derivative refugee or asylee status for a relative. However you may still be able to help family immigrate to the United States. See theFamily of U.S. Citizenspage for more information.
- The family relationship had to exist before you came to the United States as a refugee or were granted asylum:If you want to file for your spouse, you had to be married before you entered as a refugee or were granted asylum. See theApplication Procedures: Getting Derivative Refugee or Asylum Status for your Spousepage for more information.Your child had to be conceived (this means the mother was already pregnant) or born before you entered as a refugee or were granted asylum. See theApplication Procedures: Getting Derivative Refugee or Asylum Status for your Childpage for more information.
- If you want to file for your spouse, you had to be married before you entered as a refugee or were granted asylum. See theApplication Procedures: Getting Derivative Refugee or Asylum Status for your Spousepage for more information.
- Your child had to be conceived (this means the mother was already pregnant) or born before you entered as a refugee or were granted asylum. See theApplication Procedures: Getting Derivative Refugee or Asylum Status for your Childpage for more information.
